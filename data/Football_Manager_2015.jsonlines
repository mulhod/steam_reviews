For me, as a pretty hardcore player, I feel like I'm in a vicious circle just feeding my malcontent about the game, but cannot break my addiction. And hell, I've had many spells of FM addiction throughout the last fifteen years, but they are only truly rewarding when I feel I can make a difference with my particular style of play. And my preferred scenario is the lower league model, excessive scouting, wheeler dealer kind of approach, which is worth very little in 2015. The thing that works the least, for me, is that I don't feel I can truly play the game the way I would want to play it. My expectation is that somehow getting a few amazing players in a League 2 or Conference team should show. But whether it shows or not depends on chance, player ratings are very position dependent, with central midfielders taking the runt of bad ratings, however amazing they may seem. So I might spend hours searching for the coolest prospects I can find, fishing for work permits for my non-eu conquests, but getting phenomenal players on a mediocre squad matters very little. The general feeling is of a wooden game. Bizarre things happen which seem to defy reason. Some are buggy, like goalkeeper reactions, some are fixable via lengthy tactical tinkering, like defending corners, and others are the worst of all: monotonous. Long distance goals? Maybe on TV. A fast player outrunning a defender unless the latter fumbles it? Keep dreaming. Half competent goalkeepers seem harder to find than the proverbial needle. And then there's an aggressive randomness to how a team behaves and matches unfold. My \"concede within the first ten minutes syndrome\" seems unshakable. I am not saying it cannot be done, but the feeling is that it is something that needs to be fixed from the get go, rather than something that should be reasonably fine under normal conditions, like corners. And when there's a huge quality gap between your players and the opposition, it all gets hard to fathom. So why have I played hundreds of hours of this? On the one hand, the addiction. On the other, that elusive feeling when things actually do go right and you win an amzing match. But I am left frustrated because FM seems to be going nowhere, the development of the game fails to address key issues year after year. A balanced match engine. A bit of flair and a bit of the unexpected. Some character and individuality to the players. Unbiased ratings. Consistency and logic in the transfer system. Of course it's not easy and there's a lot of back and forth in trying to get it all together, but considering the heritage of this series, I cannot avoid a distinct sensation of complacency, padded with the occasional UI revamp or a couple of shiny new features. Bottom line: if you have not played this yet, maybe wait it out some more, like until SI decide to take the bull by the horns and create another classic. There are many people who enjoy working on this game and its database is a treasure trove, an inimitable advantage for anyone interested in joining the fray. The risk with taking it up is that even if you get it for free, time costs incurred are not worth the experience and chances are your passion for football will be your downfall, in spite of this.", "num_friends": 27, "num_reviews": 6, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": 31, "num_groups": 8, "steam_id_number": "fcpolifan", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 50, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.8522072936660269, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 59, "num_achievements_percentage": 1.0, "num_achievements_possible": 59}, "date_posted": "Jan 13, 2015, 3:50PM", "username": "Disco Stu"}

Manager customization has been inserted and is a step in the right direction, but not entirely. So, you will get to \"customize\" the stats of your manager. Are you more laid back or more technical? The option to customize and edit stats as such as adaptability and understand of things like attacking, defensive, etc are there. However, i don't entirely know what impact they have on the game as In my 9 hours of playing I haven't really noticed it or came across them again. I also do not know if these stats improve or worsen over time, depending on what you do - as the game does not tell you, even in the very brief tutorials. The new user interface layout is amazing and is long overdue. I actually found that I stopped playing Football Manager 2014 because of the UI. It was clunky, it was a mess and I had no idea where anything was. It was all just text and drop down menu's. Now there is a nice sidebar which provides links that take you to the most important and most used parts of the game as such as tactics, scouting, team, etc. Purchasing players is odd this year. Sometimes it is extremely easy to buy a player and others extremely difficult, for no reason - even if you are trying to purchase an already transfer listed player or a reserve player getting no games at his current club. The old \"Let me pay 100m on a 48 month deal\" STILL works. You can buy any player that wants to come to your club if you use this method and it totally breaks the entire game. My biggest gripe and the sole reason why I need to give a bad recommendation to this game: The AI and the match engine. The AI in Football Manager 2015 is the worst I have ever seen in the series. If you actually sit and watch the match unfold you will see some of the following: - Players running for a ball and stopping for no reason - The goalkeeper saving the ball, standing back and staring at the ball, which is touching his feet - A Player will chase the ball down the wing at full speed, slow down and allow a opposing team player to catch up and take the ball. - Opposing team player has the ball and stands still. All of your players are polite enough to let him stand still. - Outrages tackles: Ball is moving out of your box, opposing striker is running out of your box. There is no threat. Defender will slide tackle him as he is leaving the box and give away a penalty. - CB's that seem to play as strikers, leaving entire gaps in your defence. Red cards, injuries and own goals - EVERYWHERE. I have not went through a game yet where there has not been at least one own goal either by my team or the opposing team. They are everywhere. Red cards and injuries happen in abundance - I have had 10 players injured within the first month of a season even though I had average training and not too many games in quick succession. Tactics do not work as they are intended. If you sit down and take the time to read and learn how to create tactics, you will be so frustrated. The game gives you descriptions of what each position and instruction does, in depth. This is great. However, they do not work as they say. Short passing, retaining position and not punting the ball up the park? Team constantly just fires the ball all over the park with next to no short passing. Push higher up the park? Team sits deep. Because of these issues, scorelines can be ridiculous. In my first 5 games of the season there was a combined number of 30 goals between me and the other team. My first game finished 5-4 and my second was 6-3. This all leads to a very frustrating experience overall. Every year SI always say \"we are improving the match engine\". Where are these improvements? I have not seen any improvements, just more bugs and terrible AI. I love this series and I am a huge football fan, but I feel obliged to tell fellow consumers not to purchase this product until it vastly improves.", "num_friends": 29, "num_reviews": 14, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": 49, "num_groups": 9, "steam_id_number": "XB92AI", "date_updated": "Nov 8, 2014, 9:19AM", "num_badges": 65, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.8588516746411483, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 4, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.4, "num_achievements_possible": 10}, "date_posted": "Nov 8, 2014, 8:45AM", "username": "XB92AI"}

But there is clearly something wrong with the matchday engine. The most succinct way I can put it is that it's like they've decided Brazil vs Germany from the last WC is commonplace. I'll keep 8 straight clean sheets (or something like that) then get beaten by a promoted side 6-0, or 7-5! What's more, I've noticed other games in the league finishing 8-6, and stuff like that. Since I started counting, in three seasons I've seen goalkeepers chipped from the touchline or from inside the defending half 27 TIMES!!! The game needs a lot of work. It's a winning franchise; so, all they need to do is fix it. But don't spend your money on it until they do. They have released a very dodgy product. I've never seen an FM release like it.

Just too many issues (and it appears I'm not the only one), to mention in one review so I will list my biggest bugbears; - Injuries - like many others, each save game has been dominated with injuries (FM (Liverpool), FMC (Liverpool), FM (custom)). Of course many players get injured but I have rarely managed to field an entire matchday squad without bringing in 2/3 reserve and youth players. This means on average i have about 8 senior players injured (6-8 weeks is the most common length) - Training - there just seems to be no improvement on this side of things. It is embarrassing that you can only train your whole team as one (for example - attacking training). There is not one professional team that have all their players do the same group training schemes. Why would i want the likes of Skrtel, Toure and Sakho doing Attacking training the majority of the time? It is just lazy game designing. On top of this there appears to be a bug that a few players in your team are always upset about the high training workload - no matter what you try to fix it. - Talking to players - again it feels like this is a bit on the weak side. You only have the same options available. Sure you can try to \"convince\" players but only with intangible promises. - e.g promise to bring in high profile players but with no obvious way to figure out if the player you buy is going to appease the player - Everything is short term - \"this is my plan for this season\" - Most clubs have a 3 or 5 year plan. You should be able to lay out your plans for your contract entirety - e.g have more money in the first year to build a squad that will develop, or lay away your transfer kitty for later seasons because the squad you have now will get you promoted etc - teams still wont bid for new players or contract signees - it is very frustrating to buy a kid for the future and have to wait 6 months to loan him out. -tactics are inflexible - rarely does it work if you want to play a fast, short game. Or a slow, direct game. This is nothing like real life, remember Liverpool last season? Or Stoke every season? plus they still haven't brought back player runs - a huge miss for tactical control. The biggest problem? Matchday - I watch it on 2D to try and avoid some of the bugs but a lot of them still persist. The two most common are players not chasing down a loose ball 5 yards away from them and the worst one of all......Opponent takes a shot, kepper makes a save, ball comes back into the penalty box, keeper watches it for 5 minutes whilst the opponent runs 25 yards to stick it in the back of the net......funny thing is it only happens to your keeper. Plus the tactics you use don't have a big effect on the game. I tested this out by doing the old save/restart cheat against West Brom at home. (Tried 442,451,433 with different player combinations and tactics......each time lost 2-1 or 2-0 On the plus side it looks prettier. Unfortunately as most people point out there is no motivation for Miles and the SI team to make real improvements. Each year we will shell out 30 and receive some old rope in return. At least now you can play the beta access and get bored of the game before it's official release date. If you would like to play alternative manager games i recommend FM11 and Premier manager 97, those games felt like the developers cared", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198050674374", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.8041958041958042, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "Dec 24, 2014, 11:33AM", "username": "dariusx10"}

The matchday engine has slowly become a joke over the years, tolerable but still worsening for the past 3 editions, this one being the worst. Injuries are through the roof in this version (even after the hotfix tweaks) and its impossible to keep a players fitness up even with squad rotation. In addition to the injuries the goals are insane your team will score 100 goals a season with Anichebe as your main attacking threat but youll also concede just as many with Neuer as your 'keeper. Tactics don't seem to matter all that much, after testing it seems the main factor is your familiarity with it.

Where to start? The pros? The game is so in-depth, detailed and looks great that at first glance you feel like you are in heaven. Unfortunately, the absolutely ridiculous AI and randomness of the game ruins it for brand new players and seasoned veterans alike VERY quickly. I have played football manager games since the 1990s. I have bought every game in this Football Manager series. I have probably tens of thousands of hours of experience playing these, and have thoroughly enjoyed every FM yet. Until this fiasco. I have only played this one with two teams, Man United and Sheffield United, but the experience has been identical. The game is so damn unrealistic, that it will suck the life out of you. These are actual situations that happened in my season with Man United. A month into the season, I have lost nearly third of my team to long injuries. Some players cannot put together two games in a row before returning to the injury list. Not TOTALLY out of the question, but highly unlikely. Queens Park Rangers finished 2nd in the EPL in my first season, while Tottenham and Liverpool barely missed relegation. I finished 9th, and got fired. I kept beating the top teams repeatedly, while collapsing at home 0-5 to teams like QPR and Swansea. I lost 5-0 to a 9-man Manchester City, after winning the shots 14-5 and hitting the post/crossbar five times. Frustrating, but not impossible. But scenarios like this unfold throughout the season; the likes of Rooney and Mata cannot score regardless of opposition or their position on the field while James Wilson bangs out a 30-goal campaign, you can LITERALLY have a guy of van Persie's stature standing on the 6-yd line with an empty net and hit the post over and over again, and don't even get me started on these phantom goalies... You can be playing against a backup to the backup goalie 2 divisions below yours, and fail to score, while the opposition sinks 3 behind De Gea on three shots. I scored 2 or 3 goals from direct free kicks all season, and maybe twice from a corner. My opponents? You got it, somewhere around dozens. Now, it might sound like I'm making excuses and don't know how to manage. But as I said, I have enjoyed these types of games some 20 years, whether I win or lose. Why? Because the games have been as fair and realistic as a simulations sports game can be. Sure, there will always be that crazy 7-5 home win against some World Class team, but when it happens once every 150 games or so, that's pretty okay... There will always be that game where an underdog takes you down and leaves you extremely frustrated. But guess what, it actually happens... What doesn't happen are the scenarios I discussed above, and after some 150 hours into FM 2015, I feel like I have enough personal experience to call this game total garbage. Fortunately, FM 2013 and FM 2014 are still installed on my computer, and still offer limitless hours of fun and entertainment.

I have played football manager since 2012 and know the game in and out. Now this is the most fun football manager. But is the most fake as in a season only having one 0-0 game where I play defence with counter attack still does make for an interesting season. Having 127 goals and 58 conceded is interesting to watch as well do not get me wrong. But this is the most unrealistic football manager they have put out. Its a joke how many goals go in and how much is just plain unrealistic. Example first game in the Prem just got Middlesbrough promoted playing against Liverpool games ends 8-6 .... 8-6 !!! How does that happen? If you want an unreal intense football manager where it is all GOALS GOALS GOALS then this is for you if you want a football manager go and play the last year and just download a MOD that updates teams for you because this is not a football manager. Pros  - A lot of goals - Never a dull game - More in-depth communication with player and staff - In match team talks - Better transfer and overall balancing - Always fun most game end with a min of 3 goals - MORE GOALS GOALS !!! GOALS FOR EVERY ONE - Being able to speak to a player who does not want to come instead of being blocked by agent gives more scope to get players out of your range Cons  - Very unrealistic - Random injurie spells (not always but can end up having 9 players out for 3 weeks after 2 games and two weeks of training) So always save and quit when this starts as when it does the injuries will not stop until you cannot field a team - No matter strategy you will score a lot and concede a lot - Could still have more depth, I still think it has got too streamlined from 2012 - Players seems to get very unhappy fast and all seem to being a stubborn as a mule unless you use the talk ( X player is having good form) no matter the form they seem to agree with you - Having a one 0-0 in a hole season and 3 strikers with more than 20 goals and top 6 goals scores in the league all having more the 30 goals kind of makes it seem very unrealistic - German league rights have gone and still no badges for most top flights teams ( MODS do fix both mind) Overall For people wanting fun 7/10 People wanting a football manager 3/10", "num_friends": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": 7, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "stozer", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 4, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.7814569536423841, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 35, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.3333333333333333, "num_achievements_possible": 105}, "date_posted": "Jan 3, 2015, 5:19AM", "username": "chris_stoz"}

The game has fixed many issues in the past, and almost faultless compared to the past 2014 & 2013 versions. Things that i really enjoyed: - The new interface is very nice, but does take time to get used to. - Match Engine (Y) fantastic compared to the past. Though minor issues with ball bounces (lack of roll). - The new function to choose the type of manager you are gives the game a more in-dept feel. - Frankly the new functions gives you a lot more abilities in managing and structuring your team. - Tunnel Interviews. Though i personally hate press conferences (i'm lazy), the tunnel interviews are a very nice touch. Things that bug me a bit about the game: - The match engine's ball bounce is a bit static and does not flow. - Player's opinions seem a lot stronger. (Might just be because i am a new manager) - The new interface takes awhile to get used to. (I'm still getting my head around it) Overall my review: Visuals: 8/10 Game Engine: 7.5/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Game interface and user friendliness: 7/10 Verdict: 8/10 Definately recommended! ___________ Football Manager 2015 is the next line-up from its previous stage 2014. Equiped with an massive overhaul of the game's features and interface. This year's product was definately highly anticipated. So, here is my review of the game: Interface Frankly, it is definately a fresher look to the game. The new interface allows for players to have greater ease and control in getting to different areas/departments that they need to quickly (e.g. boardroom or squads). The overhauled interface tries to bring back memories of the older versions of FM with a updated twist, and many users may have a hard time readjusting back/to the new interface. Personally I feel the new interface is a nice idea, however does make things a bit complicated in situations, but i believe it is simply down to it being new. Give it a couple days/weeks and you should be comfortable with it. Verdict: 7/10 Game Engine With SEGA taking the game engine to a new level this year, this was simply one of the most awaited feature of this year's game. And guess what, it didn't dissapoint. With visuals now smoother and in-sync with the game, it is visually astounding when compared to 2014. Slicker moves and more cohesion in game (less ping pong of 2014), it certaintly is a big upgrade. However my criticism would be the ball physics as the bounce does give it a edgy feel with unrealistic and rather static bounce features no matter the angle of the kick. Verdict: 7.5/10 (FM2014 was a 5.5/10) Gameplay Frankly, the new features have possible added difficulty to the game, which is definately a plus point. Especially since many users grow tired/bored of the ease of winning in FM 2014. Though made slightly tougher, it is an interesting addition, with new manager formats to choose from. Finances and training did get a wanted boost and are you as a manager has more opportunities to manipulate (work with) them to your advantage. The gameplay is definately a joy to behold. Verdict: 9/10 Overall Look, no game can be perfect. Yes there are some issues with the new interface and match engine, but for a simulator such as this, FM is frankly amazing. Overall, I have to say that Football Manager 2015 is a massive improvement from its 2014 counterpart and would highly recommend it to all Football fanatics. If you are a past FM player and have been dissapointed with past versions, i honestly BEG you to revisit your perspective and try out FM15 (Please..)! It is a big step up from 2014 and is worth the money.

The transfer screen is a mess and it is hard to find new players. Everything has been hiden in strange menues and wen you finally find the thing you want to do, you cant remember where you found it. The live game is like watching a game with kids! It is not uncommen to see 8-9 players in a small area and noone can hit the ball. The keeper has two settings: Catch every ball or drop everything. It is not uncommen to see your keeper jumping high and it takes forever to hit the ground again. That makes it so easy for the attackers to score. (It is not a bug its a feature)..... Dont get me started with the freekicks! if your player has a higher rating then 1 i freeking you WILL score if it is nearer then 90 meters from the goal! Oh I forgot about the \"demands\" from the players. I played my first season as Brndby and 8... EIGHT ing players demanden to be sold. That was devestating for the morale of the team, but come on! I cannot sell 8 players in one transfer period! At the end of every season do some different players demand to get sold, and they get angry, and so do the rest of the guys, if you do NOT let them accept an offer. Not just any offer ooooh no, but a offer from the LAST transfer period. That is just plain stupid. You cannot sell a player in a closed marked! The game sucks bigtime. It is harder then ever, so even if you plays Manchester United against Bradford, you still are up for a huge chalenge! Don't buy this game! It's a mess and not worth the money!

I haven't played much of the game thus far so this mini review is based on my early experiences. I was looking forward to this years release, hoping it would be a massive improvement on last years title. Unfortunatly this isn't the case. All the things i hated about FM14 are still very much present in FM15 and much more. Personally when i play the game i like to take control of a small team and work my way up the career ladder, rather than taking control over a ready made team such as Barcelona or Real Madrid for example. Now i understand when playing in the lower leagues the game difficulty is increased and as the player you need to be more mind full of this. The the fact of the matter is in FM15 it is impossible to build a team from scratch, unless of course you cheat or have a ridiculous amount of spare time( and no i dont want to play classic mode). Player wages and contract renewals are a joke, the demands of players at the lower league level are just unfair resulting in the player leaving on a free and subsequently joining another team at the same level but for lower wages it honestly has me pulling my hair out at times. Players would also choose retirement form football all together over playing for a small team on low wages, surley a footballer would want to get his career back on track and get himself in the shop window. Everyone's a winner the club could get some much needed investment through a big transfer sale and the player is back playing pro football. I mean C'mon whats the point? Just so the game can make room for the thousands of pointless 15 year old regens(doesn't include under 18 squads) that will never play a competive match.....ever! Not that you'll know how good they are anyway seen as scouting takes FOREVER! and when they do return with a report the attributes are all ranged for instance pace could be between 8 and 15. Now in theroy i do like this idea it makes sense and encourages the player to make the most of the scouts at his or her disposal. In pratice it sucks big time to many numbers wedged into a small box, not a good design and again just adds to the confusion, with that in mind i recommend ticking the \"dissable attribute masking\" box upon starting a new game. You will still find ways to utilise the scouts. The match engine once again is so so poor, trust me i'm not being over critical just honest, but if you like seeing burger vans outside the staduim you'll probably love it even if you are losing 6-0 and every goal has contradicted your tactics in every possible way, a tactic i might add that you spent hours on before hand. Tactics have become confusing how on earth FM can attract new players to the franchise is beyond me. The game offers no help whatsoever to the first time player and a guide showing you around the new skin just doesn't cut it. Even a experienced player( NOTE NOT GOOD HA HA!) such as myself have felt a little out of my depth and i have felt on a few occasions unsure on what i can actually do to stop a losing run or how to tighen up a leeky defense, hell i'm unsure at times what exactly it is i'm doing right when i'm winning. The point is my back room staff need to contribute more, telling me to \"close down a player\" isn't always enough, tell me who would be best to use to close a player down stuff like that. Player instructions just don't work half the time, you concentrate on a certain asspect of the team and the game will punish you in other area's, if you don't want to lose the shape of your team defensivley and as such instruct the team to close down less, the A.I simply score a high amount of goals from outside the box reguardless of the goal scorers long shot attribute. Or the ball would be given away in a dangerous area like a horrendous back pass etc. It's like the A.I gets the hump when you out smart it. FM has lost it's spark, there is no fun in playing anymore, it's like it has forgotten what it is and that quiet simply is a computer game, nothing more nothing less. It's gotten far to serious for it's own good. The days of winning the champions league with Dag&Red are all but gone. I have put in roughly 11-12 hours into my first save and i'm half way through my first season having won only 2 games. I feel right now like unistalling and going back to FM 13 or even 12. I'm not saying don't buy this game, but i am saying to be mindful you could find yourself shouting at your computer screen a little more than usual, things will get broken trust me. But i suppose thats what FM is all about right? Real football mangers get stressed so it makes sense for the \"most realistic football management simulator\" for follow suit, correct? I'm sure there are alot of good things about FM15 and maybe my tactic's and team selection were crap, however having just lost 6-5 to 10 men Barrow the bad outweighs the good. It's a real shame but i truely feel FM has gone down the same road as fifa where the only real change to the game are the updated summer transfers and i'm gutted i really am.", "num_friends": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": 4, "num_groups": 3, "steam_id_number": "76561198032944804", "date_updated": "Dec 2, 2014, 10:23AM", "num_badges": 2, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.7651515151515151, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 24, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.32, "num_achievements_possible": 75}, "date_posted": "Dec 1, 2014, 4:07PM", "username": "gAnnicuS9320"}

TLDR: FM15 has improvements over FM13 and FM14, but feels like two steps forward and one step back. Veterans of the series will see that some of their main concerns have still not been addressed while other unwanted/unnecessary changes were made. My rating: 3 out of 5 A more detailed review can be found below. Long Version Pros: More dialogue choices for meetings/players ; these conversations have more benefit than previous games (and stuff like tunnel interviews). Assistants also seem to give better advice about addressing your team than previous games too. Ability to individually train players. You can choose what positions, what playing styles/habits they learn, and what individual stats you want them to focus on. Transfers seem a bit more realistic , especially when a club does not want to sell a player. Same goes for staffing transfers. My only complaint is when it comes to trying to recruit quality youth players and the clubs want 40m+ for them. I mean, I get it, but no 15 year old kid would realistically be bought for 40m euros Adding benefits to transfers/contracts seem to properly influence negotiations. Weekly/monthly payments, bonuses, even buyout clauses all seem to effect the overall bartering. More players (youth in particular) with potential, but less become actual all-stars. After the first season or two, a lot of my focus goes to developing youth players with potential. Id say out of the eight who were 4  to 5 start potential, only three of them wound up at 4+ star ability. Neutral: The interface is much simpler and easier to navigate (excluding the Tactics menu) but takes some getting used to. It feels less intuitive at first, especially for those familiar with the normal UI, but eventually becomes easy to navigate. The match engine is kind-of improved , but many of the same problems (40 shots vs 1 shot and you lose 0-1, that kind of stuff) are still ever present. 3d engine has occasional glitches during highlights but never anything game breaking. Cons: There is STILL a ridiculous amount of injuries. This was one of the problems I complained about most during the beta, and while it does seem to be toned down a bit, its still a huge issue. I understand that injuries happen in real life, but this is far too much. A good example: I was playing a season with Dortmund and had a 10 day international break. During that time four of my starters were all injured, three of them IN THE SAME GAME (and were all on the same team). Theyve fixed most of the buggy UI, but I personally like to play the game in Windowed mode and split screen with a live game or a movie or something. Many of the UI elements dont seem to account for this and either render incorrectly or reverse preferences / settings every time you change the screen. Searching for players/staff doesn't always yield proper results. Even if you enable the large database and whatever leagues you are interested, Ive still struggled to find some players or staff that actually exist in my game when trying to use the name search in the scouting field. If I go to the club and look for the player however, I can usually find them. I touched on this a bit under neutral, but I feel like some points are worth reiterating about the match engine considering the game is based around it. The game struggles with the same tactic fits them all logic like most of the previous generations have, and there is definitely the same amount of shoddy logic (like players missing open net shots, injuries occurring when no contact is actually made, and much more). Conclusion If you are a veteran of the series, I personally think the biggest hurdle will be learning the new UI. The game hasnt really made any massive improvements over FM14 and it seems like the devs neglected to address some of the main complaints from the past. Between this and the constant injuries that plagued the game , I found myself constantly making backup saves just in case five of my players come back from an international break with an injury. Overall I'm fairly happy with FM15. Granted the majority of people purchase these games just for the updated clubs and all that, but the game has a lot of potential as always. I'm personally a bigger fan of FMC than I am the more \"traditional\" FM, but they both have been improved on overall. It's definitely a step in the right direction though. If you've played Football Manager before and didn't enjoy it, this one isn't going to make you love it any more than the past ones. Id recommend waiting to pick it up on sale, or even holding off until FM16 comes out if you are on the fence. If you have FM12/13/14, you can get your footie manager fix without missing out on much.", "num_friends": 24, "num_reviews": 3, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 22, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "snarfff", "date_updated": "May 13, 2015, 5:38PM", "num_badges": 18, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.7448275862068966, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 59, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.5619047619047619, "num_achievements_possible": 105}, "date_posted": "Oct 23, 2014, 2:29PM", "username": "Snarfff"}

What an f'ing disgrace. Actual Review - Many game companies fall into the habit of getting caught up in the new features each iteration of their game come out with, while neglecting the problems inherent in the core game itself. We get it, its hard to sell a game to new customers if the biggest thing you can advertise is \"We toyed with the balancing all year!\" or \"We sorted out all the issues with the code!\". FM unfortunatly has fallen into just that trap. Anyone who has played the past several years of FM can tell you that while many new features have been added, they have by and large slapped onto a  foundation of code that struggled under the weight of a match engine it could not adequately support. Watching your 30 million pound striker send a suicide man's backpass to the keeper from an attacking postion, wingers shooting at impossible angles on goals, keepers booting the ball off their own players and into the goal... and so on. Any person with a shred of computer programming literacy could tell you that what SI needed to do was go back to square one. Instead, SI made the mind numbingly awful decission to slap a brand new, considerably more complicated match engine, on top of their  code, and had the gall to advertise it as a completely new product. Low and behold, you have one of the worst footy simulators to have graced this earth. It colapses under it own weight with comical regularity (Just watch your players freeze on the pitch for no reason, like someone turned the power off.). No patch is gonna be able to polish this turd. I'd suggest buying an older, more stable version if you have to have your fix, but then youd be supporting these crooks.", "num_friends": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": 7, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "aceintheholenp", "date_updated": "Jan 8, 2015, 5:34AM", "num_badges": 3, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.7623762376237624, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 41, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.3904761904761905, "num_achievements_possible": 105}, "date_posted": "Jan 8, 2015, 5:30AM", "username": "Aceinthehole"}

It's not a bad game on it's own, but charging AAA price for this yearly database update, and on top of that shamelessly charging 4.5 euros for the ingame editor is the last straw for me. At least give the pre-order buyers a ~40% discount and a free ingame editor, because your yearly rehash is highly overpriced right now, SI/SEGA. Honestly I don't know what I was expecting out of this year's game, it has been exactly the same for what, 5-6 years now? and that's only if you count the annoying interviews and the 3D engine, take those away, and it's the same exact game I played 12 years ago. That would not necessarily be a bad thing if they didn't ask for so much money. The things the game gets wrong, as SI would put it, include (but are not limited to): The economy is screwed up still. The poor, low reputation clubs still ask that you pay more than the player's market value, yet they set your club with their real world budget and debts! They really don't give a damn, it's all about rich clubs and England as usual (because the Premier League is the only important one. Out of 100+ leagues, 100% of people play in the Premier League, right?). The 3D match engine still looks and acts janky as all hell, defenders will just stand next to the loose ball while the opposition striker is charging in at full speed. The amount of goals scored is \"currently\" too high to be remotely realistic. I never had a game without scoring, only 3 without conceding, I beat one team 10-3, played 15 competitive matches, scored 51, and conceded 24 goals, so 75 goals in 15 matches, if I count the 4 friendlies it gets even more ridiculous. The game still has the cheating match engine, you lose to a weaker team, you know it was set up, so you reload the game to test it, you lose again, maybe 10 reloads later you get a draw, but you won't win until you give up the 3D engine and switch to text mode, or til you... that's right folks, until you buy the ingame editor and fix the game. :) - call me a noob and I'll just delete your comment (and assassinate you when you aren't looking), I've been playing the game for 12 years, and I know my tactics and training setups. Wouldn't be fair if I didn't say anything positive about this years changes, would it now? - I like the new interface. As for the recommendation, If you own the last years game, or 2013, 2012... 2004 don't buy this game, the semi updated 3D engine has nothing good to offer, and the rest of the game is totally the same, the database update is not worth the money until the game goes 75% off. If you don't own any FM games, but would like to buy one, get it at 50% off. If you're like me and pre-ordered it, go to the steam store and look at games you could have bought instead, and cry. Or keep playing this, they're bound to patch the stupid out of it at some point, right... right? Finally, here are my scores for the game: Full price score - 5/10 - Absolutely not worth 50 of any world famous currency (except Rubles maybe). 50% off - 7/10 - If you're shaking and FIFA 15 doesn't help, you might want to give FM 15 a shot. 75% off - 8/10 - Get it and enjoy it. By the time it goes down to 75% off, the patches should soften the rough edges, you'll be getting the best version of this years game at a reasonable price.", "num_friends": 168, "num_reviews": 27, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": 21, "num_groups": 38, "steam_id_number": "Dooleh", "date_updated": "Dec 24, 2014, 1:25PM", "num_badges": 13, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.7653061224489796, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 0, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.0, "num_achievements_possible": 15}, "date_posted": "Nov 12, 2014, 11:37AM", "username": "Dooleh"}

I dont understand how people can honestly enjoy or reccommend this game in its current state? Pros- Looks good and performance is fast. New interface is good and easy to use once you get used to it. Scouting has been improved. Cons- Far too many injuries ,at least one per game leading to a selection crisis. No matter what team or league I pick. Far too many high score lines, 4-4, 6-4, 7-5 , 4-3 , even against lower league teams. Goal keepers are slow to get up after a save. Defending is poor/non existent no matter what team or tactics you deploy , I have yet to keep a clean sheet. Far too many goals from long range against you. Far too many goals conceded from crosses. One game with Everton vs New England Revelation I had 30 shots on target and scored 2 goals. They had 6 and they beat me 6-2! Its not very realistic and what I expect from a Football manager game . I can put up with the high scorelines, but the constant injuries is infuriating. No matter what team or league or the set up in training etc , even the reserves seem to pick up injuries . You shouldnt have a selection headache due to injury a few games into the season. It has potential but Im only a few hours in and these issues have put me off.

As for the ME just like with FM14 and 13 at release, it's broken. You would think after 2 poor ME's at release SI would have the integrity and self respect to deliver this year... I remember when SI used to release games that didn't need a single patch. I think the monopoly SI have over the genre has made them complacent, it's only natural I suppose. Do not purchase until they have fixed the game.

Just some facts out of my head: - Injuries: seriously, so many of them, and every one must be for few months, and if it is in game it is always after you already have made all three substitutions - Transfers: Look out a bit in real world, players in lower leagues, or in clubs with budget troubles do not ask monstruous amounts of money for their players. And you dont pay player worth 50k more than 500k, but in this manager you pay it for more than 5M. - Players atributes: I wasn't sure before but i am now, they are crap. In my team i have strikers with amazing attributes for strikers and hey cant score if their life depend on it, but on the other side strikers in other teams with crappy attributes score 20+ goals in season like they play in minor league - Interviews: If i wanted to read that much and respond to all those questions i would buy a book or go to online chat and not waste money on this game. I feel like i am playing Celebrity manager instead Football - AI: now this is special story, in last manager it was bad bit it was managable, in this on it is so bad that i want to ask for refund of my money. Examples: you are playing great in first half then in secon without any reason you just start playing like local division club and easily loose by few goals, whenever you play agains favorites your players get injured early in start of match, or you get red card or penylty is awarded against you, same goes when some favorite is playing bad in season, dont wory they will bounce back to winning agains you, then there is unreal match chances like in first 5 minutes your opponent have 10+ chances, in order for you to score you need 10 \"on target\" shots while your opponents need 2 or 3, or how often happenes when you ar strong favorite that other time outplays you on home game with 30-40 chances agains you (in this managet that is every other game).

I've been playing these games for a long time (since CM96-97 since you asked), and honestly, I think this one is the best yet. There were some early problems with the match engine, and the Inverted Wing Back role is still broken (he stays wide like a normal Wing Back), but the vast majority of the most glaring issues (high scoring games, regular goalkeeping errors, etc) have been fixed in SI's patches and in good time as well. I thought the motion capture animations in the match engine would be a bit of a gimmick, but that has turned out to be a welcome addition to the game on an aesthetic level. It's by no means hyper-realistic to the point where you'd be unsure whether you're watching a match on TV or in FM, but it's a big step up from the hand drawn players of FM14. The realism (or lack of) isn't a deal breaker for me, all I want to see is a realistic simulation of a football match and in FM15, that's what we have for the most part. If you watch the matches on 'Comprehensive' highlights or higher, then you can easily see your tactical decisions playing out in front of you as the game ebbs and flows, and for that, if nothing else, FM15 is the best edition of the Football Manager series so far. Setting up a tactic is fairly simple, although not fool proof, but like any simulation, it's easy to get in to, and difficult to master. One thing I have noticed though, having spent a lot of time talking to other players and reading some of the reviews here on Steam, is that this is not a game for players who want to just pick a match day squad and have a hands-off approach to management. You will succeed at FM if you make sensible tactical choices, always be mindful of balance in your roles/duties and don't use the same approach for every match you play. Every match will play out differently. the most common complaints I've seen from others are regarding injuries and 'dominating' the game yet losing in the dying moments of the match. For injuries, I don't have these problems as I make sure my players are fully fit. Use pre-season wisely, allow your players to ease into it after coming back from holiday, then train hard and play lots of friendlies. Once the season begins, lower the intensity of training and give them all individual set ups. It takes a while, but if you do this, your players will be much less prone to injury and will develop faster as well. There will be injuries of course, but I don't have anywhere near the issues others are having, and most of my injury problems are in-game due to my aggressive high pressing style. On the domination side of things, I will say that more shots and possession does not mean dominance. Choose your battles wisely. If you're the bigger team, you can expect your opponent to sit back and hit you on the counter. Counter this yourself by playing patiently and forcing mistakes, your creative players will take care of the rest. I'm not an FM expert, but if you take these simple words of advice, then you will see for yourself how quickly things will turn around for your team. The only thing I can't comment on yet is the AI's squad development in the long term as I haven't gone far enough into the game yet. In past FM's, this has been a problem, but I can already see less instances of the AI spending millions on a player only to let him rot in their reserve team. As SI say themselves, \"it'll never be perfect, it'll never be finished\", so as long as you go into the game with that mindset, you'll get the most out of it. I highly rcommend this game for anyone who watches football analytically or who thinks they could do a better job than their favourite team's manager.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "bmcwal", "date_updated": "Dec 6, 2014, 5:17AM", "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.6745562130177515, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "Dec 6, 2014, 5:10AM", "username": "bmcwal"}

Like any crack addict, I was compelled to buy knowing the risks. Hell, I even upgraded my PC just so I could play the game properly because the last two incarnations just wouldn't work on my battered old machine. There are always problems when it first comes out. I've found that the problems persist until a patch comes out in December/January. Now for the breakdown: Good - The user interface is so much better; There is more interaction with players; You can force moves out with a gentle discussion - a great innovation. Bad - What's going on with the tactics? I was scoring plenty of goals, but I noticed that I was conceding far too many. Maybe it was my tactical setup? So, when I went into a 3-0 lead, I decided to shore up my defence. I dropped my defenders back and even my wingers. Yet, once again, I was conceding the same sort of goals - a cross into the box and finished because my full back was somewhere else or (more usually), the goalie making a save and the rebound ALWAYS falling to their striker. The end result was 4-3. My stats showed I had the tallest team in the league and thus scored most from corners. However, I also conceded the most from corners. WTF?! I developed one tactic where I gave up trying to win away and just park a bus. Still a 5-2 thrashing. I won the league scoring over 100 goals. I conceded more than the relegated teams (70). Despite brilliant fitness coaches, I was losing to loads of last minute goals. WHY, GOD, WHY?!

Spent a lot of time working on training regimens to make sure the historically injury prone have slightly less intense work outs. Spent hours working my scouts to death... Got near the start of the season and had some great transfers lined up to come in. Wanyama, Tielemans, Depay, and a few other youngins. A net spend sure but after negotiating hard deals for Kaboul, Capoue, and Adebayor I was well within the transfer budget. We are go for launch! A few days after the deals were agreed but before the players came to terms, what happens? Kaboul our 4 weeks. Capoue broken for 3 months. In training. The deals are off and I have not saved for hours. I swear to god, they made injuries a problem so you have to buy the editor. I'll need to see STELLAR reviews for any future version before I pay again. What an absolute heartbreaking shame. There used to be a game here. Update: 1-24-2015 I still don't recommend this game. I DO recommend this series. Nothing else compares to FM. There isn't a single sports management simulation in all of video games that comes close to how well FM does what it idoes. If you are a new player, get FM14. It'll be cheaper, and you don't have to pay full price for FM15 to get up to date rosters. Search the community hub and google for player and team updates and how to install them. Again, if you are on the fence, GET FM14. It's super good. Original Review: I've averaged about 650-700 hours in each years FM, dating back to 2011. I'll keep this short. There are great improvements to this game, I just wish I could get to them. Every game I start, no matter the team, no matter the training, no matter the facilities, within 2 months of day one half of my first team is injured. This game is seriously broken right now.

It is extremely frustrating, and unstoppable. I bought FM15 for an improvement of FM14, but what I got was a different interface and a circuss of a matchday engine where goals go in at an unrealistic rate, and players are playing with bones made out of toothpicks, breaking every time they pass a ball.

I was not disappointed. FM15 offers quite a bit of changes; everything from the 3D matches to the interface, gameplay and responsiveness. First off, the responsiveness of the game has greatly increased and improved. The game is far more responsive than earlier versions, and seems to go 'easier' on the processor. Second, interface. The interface has been changed drastically. Anyone who has played the previous FM installments will have a hard time at first with getting to grips with this new interface, but the change is definitely for the better. It is far more intuitive and works far better for newer players - And it might take a while to get accustomed to it but once you do, you realize exactly how much of a fabulous and welcome change it is. It makes the game navigation far easier, smoother and smarter - Which, in addition to the game's responsiveness, makes for a very fluid gaming experience. The 3D matches however, are not to my liking. The cartoonish graphics and unrealistic movement of the players reminds me more of FIFA 95' than a modern game. In my eyes, this is a step back from FM14 in fact, and hinders the game somewhat as the players score unlikely and unrealistic goals sometimes, or commit some extremely unrealistic movement and the entire feel of it is just awkward. But, now, my last and most important point: Gameplay. My god has this changed. The whole game feels incredibly new, the tactics screen is much easier to navigate through, the inbox makes your life incredibly easy (With interactions with players/transfers/almost anything can be done directly from the inbox when prompted with a message about it), transfers are *far* more realistic, negotiations about contracts too, player interactions have seen a major improvement, as have interviews with the press and team talks. Heck, even the backroom advice is better! The entire \"Interaction/conversation\" section is much easier to navigate through, works far better and more fluildy and seems to have a much greater impact on the game. Players seem to interact better and more often, and their interactions have real positive or negative effects on your team and the game and that's absolutely fantastic. It's one of the major things that has been missing, proper interactions. Many people have stated that the game is unrealistic, that they lose all the time or get injured all the time - And I have one thing to say: Review your tactics. The game is *NOT* broken. I've been playing for a while now with Arsenal (The most injury stricken team ever) and I've only had two injuries so far, both of them under three weeks out for the players - And the players are extremely susceptible to injuries (Jack Wilshere and Gibbs), so it's understandable. The scores have been realistic so far as far as I'm concerned, and from what I can tell, the problems people have been having directly link to their inability to adapt to the new game interface and inability to create proper tactics. The only real thing that bothers me about this game however, is the fact that the \"Current Ability\" and \"Potential Ability\" ratings for players seems to have decreased extremely from FM14 for some odd reason, and in some places it's truly uncalled for. I mean, for example, how can it be that Alexis Sanchez's Current Ability is only 165, when he's clearly having a *much* better season than, for example, Sergio Aguero whose Current Ability is around 180? That's just ludicrous. But let's be real, I'm happy that this is the only bad thing I can say about this game (And the 3D part), I mean, that's the least of our worries. Eventually, the Football Manager series heavily relies on tactics, not on individuals, and that's what makes it great and that's also what makes this flaw really minor. I highly recommend this game and see it as a step in the right direction for SI.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "LugzanRellk", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.7361111111111112, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "Jan 26, 2015, 2:49AM", "username": "Nazgul Killer"}

TLDR: Doesnt really have much to recommend it over previous iterations. Technical: This game is number crunching heavy, yet the developers continue to take the approach of resisting the implementation of any sort of 64x option that would allow people to make fuller use of their hardware which would result in a more immersive experience as it would be viable to run more data at a faster speed. It really is just exactly the same stuff as last year wrapped in a different skin. Between Matches Gameplay: The UI takes a bit of getting used to, but isnt that bad once you have played for a while. A couple of screens (such as the headlines screen) sports a facemelting array of bright, conflicting colours, which could have been designed more tastefully. Player acquisition has been tightened up, but not in a good way. It is now very difficult at lower levels to find players outside the nation you are operating in, and 100% of the time they will be unwilling to sign for you. You can hold a \"discussion\" with them to try to convince them otherwise, but even when you get a seemingly positive response they still refuse to negotiate. There are some RPG elements that allow you to increase your characters attributes by taking coaching courses, however there are instances of the board agreeing to a coaching course then it simply doesnt happen, with no notifications given. Basically a lot of these newer features are pretty buggy. Theres also a lot of nonsense around player interaction as usual, such as players wanting to leave, you transfer list them, no one comes in. You offer them mutual termination (remember, they have asked to leave), and they get highly offended and take a hissy fit. Press conferences are another bugbear with this edition of FM. They quickly become repetitive and tedious as usual, and before long you will find yourself having to answer more press conferences and more questions than ever, as you are now accosted in the match tunnel before and after games, in addition to pre and post match conferences. While you can assign your assistant to pick this responsibility up, its usually not a good idea as they trend towards controversial and team morale destroying options. Matches: There are a few neat touches that improve the look and feel of stadiums. You will also occasionally see things like banners with your team name on them if you reach cup finals etc. Goalkeepers are incredibly broken to the point that you might as well have a traffic cone in goal. It looks as though they are trying to pull off some sort of 90 minute comedy routine given their inaction to prevent any sort of goal attempts. A lot of games end up looking like rugby scorelines simply due to the terrible goalkeeping AI. Expect results such as 6-4 very regularly. The goalkeepers are not helped by the ongoing issue from FM14 of defenders standing around and ballwatching. This every few games means that when passbacks occur, both defender and goalkeeper stand still, while an opposition attacker will stroll from the middle of the field past your defender and knock it in past your inert goalkeeper. Players will also \"skate\" (move without animation) and occasionally perform bizzarre and immersion breaking animations such as tumbling over a few times on the spot when falling, which makes for some strange viewing. Bluntly: the match engine is a complete shambles. Community: As always, most of the players who play this game are great, and there isn't really the sniping and animosity that you get from most game communities. The community management itself however is an absolute disgrace, with a clique of white knight moderators censoring and deleting any kind of criticism towards the game. This gives the impression that SI are extremely arrogant and disinterested in their customers. If you pick this game up, unless you enjoy brown nosing, it is adviseable to stay well clear of FM's official forums.", "num_friends": 29, "num_reviews": 7, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": 33, "num_groups": 10, "steam_id_number": "76561197993226678", "date_updated": "Oct 27, 2014, 2:06AM", "num_badges": 27, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.6842105263157895, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 11, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.23404255319148937, "num_achievements_possible": 47}, "date_posted": "Oct 27, 2014, 2:00AM", "username": "NextGame"}

Upon reading reviews of this game (largely negative) I was very cautious on purchasing this, but I still did as I love FM. I'll start with the positives, I like the new interface, it makes it much easier as everything is in front of you in one screen rather that lots of drop-down menus having to be opened. It also looks alot smoother and I like having world news opened up in a tab after skipping a day which means I wouldn't have to subscribe to other teams and leagues or some players. Negatives? hold your breath because this could be a long one depending on how much I want to type. I have played three competitive matches with my team Oxford United and here are the scorlines: 4-2 Burton (W), 1-5 Wolves (L), 6-3 Mansfield (L), that's 8 goals scored and 13 goals conceded in three games. Outraged enough as it is. I saw lots of people reporting situations like a large amount of injuries, the high-scoring games, players with apparent mental and physical disabilities, too many own goals.. Well, in those 3 games I had expereinced all of these things. During the match against Mansfield alone I had an injury (my 6th in total including the 2 I started with), my right back halting mid-run unchallenged then leaving an opposition player to score 1 on 1, and then two own goals just to add to my misery. Who knows I may just be getting all the rubbish out of the way early and the remainder of my entire FM15 career with be rage free (yeah sure, good luck with that son), but in my honest opinion do NOT buy this game if you are capable to rage and wait until it is cheaper/there has been a patch which sorts this out. Come on guys, wake up. This is poor.

However, as it has been discontinued, I had to move to Football Manager. A friend taught me the ropes, and I've been playing for a while. I played with Liverpool, AC Milan, Bayer Leverkusen and Atltico Madrid. No game has gone to mid-season. I studied, researched and spent a lot of time talking with friends about this game. I wish I hadn't. This is just the worst Manager game I've ever played for a simple reason: Nothing you do matters. I bought Marco Reus and Alex Oxdale-Chamberlain to play on the wings. Might as well have kept the money for myself and used Emile Heskey and Djimi Traor there. The most skilled player cannot dribble past the worst defender. The best crosser of the ball cannot beat the first man. The tallest and best header cannot score 3 goals a season from crosses. Every team play the exact same way, and most goals come from the same three things: Shots from outside the box, defensive mistakes and free-kicks. In upwards of 300 hours spent in the game, I don't think I saw a single goal from a corner. However, three times I saw a goalkeeper handle the ball outside the box and get booked, and two of those free-kicks resulted in goals. Players are so unbelievably stupid that it's annoying. Steven Gerrard to take a free kick on the edge of the box. You think he's going for goal. No. He's going to pass it back to the left back, who will then try to dribble and lose it. You think Asmir Begovic is a good goalkeeper? Well, he's not above handling the ball outside of the box when trying to boot it upfield. I'd always been told that Football Manager was all about the tactics, and that it is the hardest thing to manage. Well, it is hard. Specially because no matter how you set your team up to play, they will always play the same way. You can try to get the best passers of the game, but they will misplace at least 30% of their 6 yard passes. This is so frustrating I'm at a loss for words. Injuries? Well, how's this for a list. Before the third match of the season, I had the following players injured: Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson, Alex Oxdale-Chamberlain, Alberto Moreno, John Flanagan, Marco Reus, Adam Lallana, Daniel Sturridge, Asmir Begovic and Mario Balotelli. That's BEFORE THE THIRD MATCH! All of those players (bar Lallana and Reus, who are injured at the start of the season) got injured during pre season! Seriously? Unless this game is heavily patched to fix everything that's not just wrong, but plain dumb, I'll be forced to stop playing a genre I really enjoy because EA were not competent enough to keep FIFA Manager going, and because SEGA apparently have no clue what a football match looks like. I'll wait and see.

So I thought I would post a review to explain why. I will first point out that I have a strong interest in football. I wouldn't say I watch the matches, but I am always reading news stories online and am up to speed with the majority of world football headlines. I will also say I am not a massive fan of the FIFA series of games produced by EA. They seem to have a very immature audience whenever I have tried to play them online and that is something which puts me of immediately. Football Manager (the series), puts you in the office of a Football Manager (shocker huh?), you take on all the jobs that a football manager does, from setting up tactics, to training sessions all the way to signing new players for your team. Personally, I find myself getting very immersed in this game. There is something really special about taking a team from one of the lower leagues, all the way up to being the best team in the world. Once you pass the first couple of seasons, the players which are around today all start to retire, move onto different teams etc, this is when the game really begins. The game will create computer generated random players, these are called regens. How good these regens are depends on a number of things, but mostly the training and youth facilities you have at your club. There is nothing more satisfying in the this game, than finding a young 17 year old unknown kid, and training and developing him into a world-class footballer.

I had one game where the opposition went in and stoked it up and I had 9 injuries as a result with the opposition having no yellow cards.

I have to say this year, there are way more bugs then every other years. I played 50 hours in the first 3 days of the release of the beta version and I spotted about 10 problems. Because this is my favourite game I just keep playing and identify bugs in the bugs forum so my favourite game can be fixed. Yet, I waited after two updates, the game is still not fixed. Bugs that are still not fixed: - After stadium expansion plan got cancelled, the finishing date still highlight on the calendar. - Rooney get unhappy because pre season training start too early even though it is nearly december. - Defenders with at least 15 pace and 15 acceleration chase down the ball that has passed the defenders line ridiculously slow. THIS IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING BUG. HOW CAN PHIL JONES OR JONNY EVANS OR RAFAEL CHASE DOWN A BALL SO SO SO SLOW, IT IS PRETTY MUCH SLOWER THAN OTHERS WALKING. THE OPPONENT END UP GETTING BALL EASILY SINCE THE DEFENDERS CAN'T EVEN GET THE BALL WITH 50 METRES HEAD START. Throughout the 3 seasons, I've seen this occurred 20 times, so I'm quitting until it is fixed. - Set-piece marking is completely broken, i set pretty much all my players to defend, 3 form wall and 7 markers against 5 opponent. Yet 3 out of 5 opponents are completely unmarked and freely roaming around on the side of my wall. - Team selection layout maybe a minor issue, but it can be annoying if you have a big squad or you want to pick someone in the youth team. There used to be a sub slots column next to starting formation/line up, now it it gone. You now have to drag a player from the players list to the substitute slots on the same list. Picking substitute has never been harder in my life. - Budget adjustment in my first season at ManUtd, I can adjust the transfer budget to zero so i can have 3.6 Mil per week for wage budget. The second season, i adjust it all the way to wage budget, but i can only get 3 Mil per week wage budget. So that means my minimum transfer budget is 60 MIL. I'm paying players 3 Mil wage per week so whats the point of having maximum 3 Mil for wage budget and 60 Mil for transfer budget? Why can't I have all my transfer budget all my wage budget? - There are many more... I have posted all the bugs I've spotted on the bugs forum but all i get is pissy tone replies or thread closed for lacking evidence. They expect me to download this thing so I can post the game file on the server for them, and I've try installing it on my mac countless of time, it failed to install. Not to mention it is sponsored by MACKEEPER, A FREAKING MAC VIRUS. I tried to posted screenshot on the forum, it never works. They recommended this other software which has 2 weeks trial for free, DO I HAVE TO PAY TO HELP THEM IDENTIFY THE BUGS? I tried upload so videos of the bugs so my thread doesn't get close down, and i get all these pissy replies. Since there server doesn't work, i upload the game file on a file hosting website, they still expect me to upload it on a server that never works on my mac. Mostly unappreciated replies when I'm trying to help them, occasionally I get a nice reply but I am very unhappy with the game. I save up my pocket money to preorder it, paypal converted the money to profit them, I got charged by banks with overdrawn fee and I get a game full of rubbish.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198068959234", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.8, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "Nov 13, 2014, 7:00PM", "username": "dtk656"}

First of all injuries are outragious, you are guaranteed to get an injury a game and can find yourself without you key players only 4 games in to the season. Second problem is the 'New match engine' the amount of times my players have just stood there and watched Charlie adams ping a 50 yard screamer in whilst my keeper does nothing is ridiculos, seriously though the AI rarely do anyting. The transfers are so unrealistic, the value of a player might be 10 million but you will end up having to pay 40 million for a decent player. Finally the worst part is the inconsistency of the matches, you can go and play Manchester City away and thrash the 6-0 and then lose at home to West Brom 4-0 this was a problem in early FM 14 and that got soon fixed, im not saying you should win every game but the game feels too inconsistant, there isnt enough realism in matches. I have been looking forward to FM 15 for a while now and am quite dissapointed so far:( at this stage tbh i wouldt recommend FM 15 untill things have been changed, people are rating this game because \"I told my player i was gonnna sell him and he got upset\" that has been in FM for an age and isnt a real addition, there are positives of this game but not enough.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 1, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": 3, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198044990646", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 2, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.6451612903225806, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 42, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.4, "num_achievements_possible": 105}, "date_posted": "Oct 29, 2014, 5:39AM", "username": "vRAMPAG3"}

These are all game play issues: 1) A FEW Players ratings. Messi is 20 everything as usual but he didn't have a great last season like he usualy does. Some players are quite underrated such as Di Maria and a few Atletico Madrid players. Ronaldo has 15 acceleration.... (not sure how that works.) 2) Some errors made by defenders and keepers are simply unexplainable.(not sure if it's a bug or not). Sometimes the defenders just heads/pass the ball back towards the keeper and then the keeper just stands there making no attempt of clearing it whilst an opposition is running towards it. 3) When players dribble they run into teamates far too often. Which is quite unrealistic as it hardly ever happens in real life. 4) This is a very irritating one. Players misses 1V1's far too much, if they have 4-5 '1V1' chances they'll manage to score one.... This is very unacceptable as in real life players in top leagues simply don't miss all those chances. You could say that they are having a bad game but it's happening consistantly throughout the season. Also the opposition always manage to score them when they have the chance. But our players just blast it strait at their keepers. 5) Final one so far... Players some how manages to score some incredible long shots but they simply just blast it over the goal when they are at the 6 yard box which is again unexplainable (sometimes it is harder to miss then to just get it on target). So far I havn't seen a single finesse shot by my players and only 1 from the opposition. Please could you fix these issues.

The game engine, match engine and what is referred to as the AI, actually just a randomisation engine based on mathematical equation, is defective. The players do not have any realistic actions or movements. The defensive simply does not work, especially crossballs which is impossible to defend against. Your central defenders will try crossballs from deep regardsless of their shortt passing and less risky passing. Your team will miss 4-5 Clear Cut Chances every match, the opponent goalkeeper will always play high above level and your opponents players are always faster then yours. There has been so much focus on the administrative part of the game, that the actual playing a match part of the game has been overlooked. And as for the administrative part, it is boring and doll. Constant and repeating media questions before and after every single match, makes one set of the assistant manager to handle it. Individual traning for players is gone completely in order to facilitate new players, basically making the game easier to the point of being dumb. And this is in normal mode, they originally made the FM Classic mode for that purpose. There are a few positives like the new scouting system and staff system, and the UI has been improved as well. But those things are easily forgotten in the face of the overwhelming onslaught of errors and lazy programming. All in all it is hard to see how this game got through testing... Just kidding, SIgames never test their games before release. And they do not care about correcting errors and flaws. Most of what I have written was reported doing the beta fase of the game, but nothing was done about it. The beta was version 15.1 and the game is now on 15.1.3, so 3 versions later and nothing has changed. My advice, do not buy this game. It is defective and it is unlikely that it will ever be fixed. It reminds of FM2005 and FM2013. They were defective from the beginning and it was never fixed. PS. The metascore is faked.

Oh and did I mention that some of the User Interface is completely bugged? And I mean completely! Try organizing your custom view and watch as some of your options *do not appear*. You want to sort by position; sure, wait then why does it sort by ability when I click position? To Suggest this game would be to encourage this type of lack luster game developing that is become the norm.

By the January update the game will most likely be pretty much a bug free, which is when most people buy the game anyway. The new match engine is very promising and I think it's already better than in the previous versions. The new touchline team talks also seems to be working pretty well and the add another dimension to the game. The new scouting system is also superior compared to the previous versions. And then the new UI... It's again way better than before and having the side panel back just makes it's so much easier to navigate through the menus. So overall I think it's the best Football Manager game to date, although it still have a few bugs here and there. If you are a fan of the Football Manager franchise then this is definitely a must buy. Remember that the christmas sales are coming soon so it's probably worth waiting till then if you haven't got the game already by now.

There are things wrong with the match engine as others have pointed out, but the whole series has emphasised width over depth since it moved from being CM to FM - I've been playing since Domark versions on the Amiga. I remember when we only had text based commentary and the tension was incredible, there was the feeling of just being given enough information and let your imagination fill in the gaps. FM2015 in particular gives you so many features it can initially feel overwhelming, until that is, you realise it doesn't really matter. Keep your players happy, make sure your tactics are reasonably sane, gradually improve your squad, and well that's it... Obviously, you can complicate that as much as you like if that's what you want, but the whole game experience is totally flat now. Every iteration just adds a couple more features that aren't really fleshed out much on top of a bunch of features from previous iterations that haven't been developed further once they have been introduced. All we seem to really pay 40 (assuming you buy on release) for is a data update and a quick polish - it makes no difference if the dev team have put thousands of hours into each version if the end-users experience is so stale - it's lost sight of the end-user experience, and that's what hurts so much. The adding of in-game purchases is also a massive turn-off for me (and others who have given up on FM sooner than I inevitably will); seriously, micro-payment to increase your club's bank balance? Buy editor access? Purchase no transfer restrictions? Whose idea was this?

And I play this game at a good level for 6 years I know how to reduce them. It is just broken. -Players are just . Just 3 weeks after some jackass signs a new contract, he becomes unhappy with his contract and asking for a new one. If a player is playing well, he becomes unhappy in any case, he wants more salary, a new challenge or is flattered by interest of a bigger club. Player is on international duty for 40 days and he becomes unhappy for not being in the first team. Same goes with injured players. -I have a squad of 24 players. 21 of them are on international duty and I have a semi final match. Game is simply absurdly ed up. You can't make any alterations on your fixture, you can't interact with the FA or your club board for most cases. After all, I could write down a 50-page list on things that are  in the game. I won't. I just want to tell everyone who considers buying the game: I feel like they intentionally made it so  so that we will be forced to buy the ingame editor.

Pretty much the same as the others but upgraded. More animations and more....animations. More features as well, apparently, but we'll get to that soon. I was excited for FM 2015, as i normally am whenever a new version comes out. I start up a save where i'm unemployed with a Sunday League reputation. This time i have to think about the coaching badges as well. I don't want any. I will start at the very bottom. Then i experience some RPG attribute thingy. Am i a tracksuit manager or a tactical manager? Hell if i know. I am both but according to the game i kind of have to choose one or the other. I like the idea but i find it a bit too gimmicky. Loading up every single league the game comes with, and a large database. Takes me about 15 minutes before i can start playing for real. The game progresses smoothly. No problems being over the recommended player limit, yet. I'm in the year 2025 now and still no problem. Granted, it slows down a bit when changing months, changing year and during transfer deadline days; but i expected that. Playing the game itself is a bit like a tiny rollercoaster ride. I love playing the game but there are so many tiny bugs and features that don't work very well. Sidebar. I don't mind it but it gives me less room for customised screens. While on the subject customised screens; A complete mess. I \"warned\" them about these kind of things on SI's forums. Small tiny bugs like these might seems small but they will come back and be a bigger issue. It's been there for a long, long time and they haven't done anything about it. It wasn't prioritised and now they're struggling to figure out how to fix it. Go figure Customising screens is a nightmare. Columns disappearing left and right, when you have plenty of room on the screen. You just want to adjust the width of one column a few mm. \"POOF\" an entire column or two, gone. Very annoying, as i customise most of my screens. Player interactions are just a complete mess and do not work properly. An entire team in outrage because a 17-year old, who wouldn't get anywhere near the bench of my local 10th-tier real-life club. Amazing. Nobody would care. Not even the 17-year old himself. Players complaining that they want to play more games. We are in the middle of the bleeding holidays. We don't have another game for 3 months. Then comes back and wants to leave because i didn't keep my promise of playing him. We're still one and a half month away from our first friendly. Then, when i try to sell him, he complains that i'm trying to force him out of the club. Well....kind of, yeah?! You wanted to leave becuase of playing time and me not keeping promises, so now you want to leave, because i was trying to let you leave because you wanted to? Player interactions is a big mess. One big negative from me is: Tactics screen. Lord, oh lord, what have they done?! FM14 had the close-to-perfect tactics screen and then they change it, for no apparent reason. Change it to something a thousand times worse. Now, to be fair, they have updated the tactics screen with their patches, so it looks a bit better. To a new player, i don't know what to say. I, personally, don't like the tactics screen at all. I simply don't use it. Backroom advice. My coaches are still offering me contradicting advice. Why the hell would i want my left fullback dribble on the right hand side when you just told me to train him so he doesn't do that anymore?! I could write a whole lot more about the ups and downs with this game but i'll just do this: I do enjoy the game quite a bit, but it's not the best FM. Far away from it. Another not-complete version of this game, which i am getting a bit tired of. It seems like it's acceptable that this is always a game in progress. It will always be in progress and i understand that. But each released version should feel like a complete product. It doesn't, and it hasn't done that for a long time. People on the forums wants features and more features. On one hand they get applauded for doing so, but when things aren't working so well they get the defenders shouting, they're just a small company. If they're not so big then stop adding so many features. Stop adding more than they can handle, which seems to be the case, more and more each year. More features doesn't equal better product. It also needs to work properly, which it doesn't. This seems like an overly negative review, and it kind of is. But i have to say that i do enjoy this iteration as well. I'll still have, probably, over a thousand hours in this game, when FM16 comes out. Having a lot of fun. Finding it harder, personally, than any other version but i love the challenge. I do recommend this game. Make no mistake about that!!! I'll leave this review with the things that bothers me the most about this FM2015: Cons: - Player interactions doesn't work properly - Tactics screen X 1000. It's just many steps back from what they had. - Issue with getting players match fit in lower leagues - Too easy overacheiving when you have the right tactic (compared to real life) - Scouting is very tedious and doesn't work properly - Customising screens doesn't really work", "num_friends": 23, "num_reviews": 5, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 17, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "roykela", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 13, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.6037735849056604, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 46, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.4380952380952381, "num_achievements_possible": 105}, "date_posted": "Dec 24, 2014, 2:34AM", "username": "roykela"}

Aside from this, everything else has been great. Tactics have been spot on, I also tested a few tactics from the Workshop and I was surprised at how good some of them were - but it didn't make an instant difference. Some tactics took a good 5-10 games to start flowing nicely, otherwise I would find myself conceding at least 2 goals per game. This year I was focusing solely on gaining most of the achievements rather then spending my life going through season to season with my favourite team. I've been an admirer of these games since Championship Manager 98' and think I've purchased it every year from then. It is true that a lot of the \"updates\" could quite easily come into a nice dlc bundle or same game \"upgrade\", however this is not the case. People should note that they are not forced to buy the game every year, their are plenty of dedicated people within the football manager community that focus on updating the databases for older game titles in order for those to keep playing the old game, with the new data.

There have been numerous occasions where you will go into half time with a score at 3-3 or more. An example of this was when I was playing as newcastle and in a game against Liverpool I was 4-2 up at half time only to eventually loose the game 8-5. This seems to happen all the time. The second is the goalkeepers. I have seen some absolutely blinding saves where a goalkeeper will jump from one end of the goal all the way to the other and still hold the ball. The next minute a shot from 30 yards will go right down his throat and he seems to jump out the way of it. The goal kicks are often very strange. I have often been in the situation where the keeper will simply pass it to the opposition striker who simply puts the ball in the net. Extremely frustrating as you can imagine. In addition to this is if a goal keeper makes a save but doesn't hold onto the ball he seems to forget all about it. Your defenders will also have no interest in it. The only person who is will be an opposition player who will run 45 yards for a simple tap in. But it only ever seems to be against you. It can be comical at times where the defenders are turning on the spot looking in all directions, the goalkeeper wandering around the six yard box and a striker skipping through and tapping it in. General mistakes with the engine involve every other position as well. If you're thinking of getting this game, DON'T! Wait until they fix it or steer clear for good.", "num_friends": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": 5, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "hailstones23", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 2, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.7222222222222222, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 26, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.3058823529411765, "num_achievements_possible": 85}, "date_posted": "Jan 10, 2015, 12:46PM", "username": "Hailstones"}

I know this is just a beta and i have only played a few hours on this game, i have encountered problems which i dont know whether I am terrible at managing arsenal or that the bugs are really messing me up. 1. Lots and LOTS of own goals, it happened that Calum Chambers scored a hatrick of own goals against QPR which ultimately lost me the game. 2. Injuries, injuries everywhere. At least all my players have been injured once since i have been in charge (4months) and it is getting ridiculous. Debuchy was injured for 3 months then i played him once he got fit and got injured again for another 2. It is getting out of hand. 3. Goalkeepers. Where do i begin? Goalkeepers do the craziest  in the entire world, sometimes it can be funny and other times its frustrating as fwuak. It is also not my own gk aswell when i check other games replay, the goalies can be proper (sorry). Other than those issues this game has been great for me. I absolutely love the tactics menu, the new scouting system and more player interaction. Even though this game does have its issues, it should not be discouraged to play it. I am sure these issues are being brought up by SI and they are trying to fix it.

However this game is awful- I have deleted it from my computer and won't be playing it again until it has been patched. I bought Guardado a three star left mid for back up to Tadic- I gave him a backup squad member contract- after THREE premier league matches where he came on as a sub in two he began moaning. Tadic then got injured for 6 months (surprise surprise), it took Guardado 16 premier league matches as a starting player to get over it. BACK UP SQAUD MEMBER??? I was Southampton (decent top-half premier league side), I conceded 86 goals in 38 premier league games. I tried everything- defensive fullbacks, five at the back, two defensive midfielders, defensive setup, rigid approach, new defensive coaches etc etc etc. Nothing worked, I thought maybe it was a bug with my game... I restarted with Southampton, spent my entire transfer budget on my defense and yet again conceded 75+ goals in a single premier league campaign.

I have my highlights set to key so when I see Memphis Depay cut inside, I get all pumped up, and then, nope, he kicks it out of the stadium. The injuries are also annoying. Sure it's realistic, but every pre season I end up with at least 5 key players getting injured before the opening match of the season. It gets better as the season goes along, and I know it's because of low match fitness in pre season, but it's stupid. This needs to be fixed. There are some positives though. The scouting and coaching is a lot better than in previous FMs, and the transfers are also realistic. The only problem with the transfers is that all the youth players want the same deal and they won't budge at all unless I give them 20k a week.

Regarding the ME, there seem to be a lot of goal from crosses making a tactic with wingers like 4-5-1 maybe too rewarding.

This is the first year that it has disappointed me so much that I actually tried to lobby to get my money back from Steam rather than trust the patch system to right the ship. Steam obviously flat out refused to help me which I guess its written in the rules, and steam lacks any sort of heart for its customers so that was a wasted effort. My main irritation is the injuries. It seems some of you experience the injury issue and some don't. Working with Sounders FC within two friendlies and a league game I lost Obafemi Martins, Brad Evans, and Pineda to injuries during the match. 4 days later in what I put in as light training I lost Chad Barrett for 4 months, and Ozzie Alonso for 3 months. Those injuries crippled my team for a grand total of 5 months, all within the span of a week. In my entire life of ever watching soccer/football I have never ever seen this happen. This is supposed to be the most realistic league simulator in all of gaming right? Well not anymore. The other glaring issue is whicher agorathim they use for what I call the \"fair shake factor\". In my first friendly I had the Seattle Sounders with mostly starting level players going up against a regional team (Semi pro at best) and I got smashed 4 to 1. Sounders FC almost never get beat, especially to teams from what I would consider a beer league team. This is terrible. They broke Football Manager 2015 as far as I can tell.

I guess im wrong. So i started my game, the last coach had ended his career with 5 wins streak. So i felt pressured to win in the begin. Won 2 matches were my team was expected to tie. So far So good. Then i started noticing it. Next match starts. Everythings fine. My Defender is about to get the ball... Know what happens? He sundenly slows down and nearly stops walking, enemy striker gets the ball and scores. I tough it was a isolated mistake of the match engine so i continued. Next match my striker was running foward, grabbed the ball, man on man vs the keeper, he stops running and 4 defenders reach him. He can easily score from there. Does he shot? No. He tries to dribble the 4 defenders by going in the MIDDLE of them. Later i saw my striker running, he had no chance to get the ball, enemy defender did the wost pass i ever saw and fell into the ground for no real reason then started crying. My striker had a chance in front of the goal man on man. He kicks the ball slow and near the keeper and... its in?! Might be a bug. Thats when you start noticing every corner kick that is going to ANY PLAYER BUT A STRIKER near the first post will go in. Works for both sides. My Defender did a hat trick with those corners, striker had even more opportunities by the same way and didnt kick the ball. Enemy also scored like this, between my defenders leg that is. Im not opening this game again until january update,i swear to god. SI should release FM at january instead of releasing it at november every year with the match engine sloppier and sloppier.

So, by using the in-game editor, and magically transferring players like Messi, Ronaldo, Bale, Ramos, Pique, T Silva, Vidal, etc to Man Utd - don't expect to go play the next game and walk all over the opposition - in fact, I gave up when I was being hammered 7-2 by Aston Villa - I've been replaying the Aston Villa game for hours (to try to at least draw with them) - it's not fun. Opposing AI players have a frustrating ability to just seem faster and more skillful than any player your team has - so, it's like a player like Ronaldo or Messi play worse - basically Aston Villa are playing like they have inherited all of the skills of my team - like it is a glitch/bug - Aston Villa can run up the wing and cross the ball and score, nobody touches the ball, the winger just runs up the touchline and fires the ball into the back of the net (from the wing) - they can even do that twice in a game. Aston Villa are scoring astonishing, world class, goals. Messi, Ronaldo, Bale, etc are struggling to play at Sunday League level. I will buy the fact that you have to somehow find a tactic that works - but how the hell does this affect Ronaldo's, etc ability to run with the ball? There's just no fun in magically transferring players to your team and they, all of a sudden, don't have a clue how to play football. They react slower - to me it is like they are hindered by something. Yet, it's fair to say, other people will claim that they could magically transfer great players to their team and just win 10 - 0 every game. So, for me, the game is potentially only fun if you prefer the tactics of football and can work out the combinations. Long gone are the days of the older FMs or CMs when you literally could buy the best players in the world and just destroy everything in your path without too much thought about tactics. I think I will struggle to continue playing this game, because re-playing Aston Villa for hours (in real-life) just to at least draw with them is kind of pointless.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561197970440006", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.625, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "Nov 8, 2014, 6:04AM", "username": "ploppo"}

Some nice new features include the touchline shouts which I'm still looking at the effects but generally seem to be working ok. Some tweaks with the scouting and man management options too which I like a lot. The engine itself is different enough to distinguish itself from previous games yet isn't a true evolvement, more upgrade than paradigm shift. Visuals have been upgraded all over.

This game is like taking two dice, rolling them and giving scores to each team. Your tactics? Mean nothing. Your squad of players? Mean nothing. You can say this review is based on only 1.2 hours of gameplay and you'd be right, but if you add that to the hours sunk into 2014 (which is pretty much the same) and the fact I've played football manager since it's Championship Manager days I do not need to put more hours into seeing this game fall on it's  over and over like the last 2 seasons. The game has become over complicated to the point that instead of your knowledge of football being tested, it's your patience that this game tests with it's absolute random results. Results like Elche 3 Barcelona 0... followed by Barcelona 5 Atletico 0 and we round off the 3 matches with Barcelona 0 Real Madrid 7 - er... yeah. The same players that got me a 5-0 win also lost to a nothing team by 3, and then destroyed by Real Madrid. Even if I had no tactical knowledge whatsoever in football, Barcelona shipping 10 goals in 2 games whilst scoring 5 in another is just absolute horse s**t. In real life I'd have to put Messi in goal and Neymar on the bench! to ship 10 as Barca! I do prefer to start in the lower leagues mind you, however seeing those results I don't think I like the idea of being hammered 10 or 11-0 every game so stopped short of starting an actual longterm game. I have no doubt there will be players saying \"You just don't know what you're doing\" to which I'll just get in first with, yes I do - saved you time typing your tired and ill informed response. I have a very good knowledge of footballing tactics, training regimes and how good a player SHOULD be in certain positions based on stats, however this game does not reflect any of that. I also know that too many new players can cause issues with morale and so forth. I understand an over heavy training regime could effect the players performance. I know that a 4-3-3 doesn't work... in any top division. I know that introducing new players slowly to the team is sometimes better than throwing them in with a 90 minute debut. I've read \"tips\" pages, I've read \"FAQ's\" I've been playing the series and it's predecessor since 1992 and usually have a great time taking smaller clubs over, and with time building them into bigger clubs.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "fleisch82", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.7777777777777778, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "Feb 7, 2015, 11:07AM", "username": "shibbydez"}

You'll also concede thousands of goals from corner kicks: usually it's corner kick- goal or corner kick-corner kick again-goal or even 3 times in a row and then you concede, and I'm having this crap more than once every 2 games.

New features, player updates, \"great match engine\" etc. What could go wrong? Lots. The \"match engine\" is pathetic. Thats the only word for it. Heres why: Keepers constantly spill the ball onto opposition players. Midfield just stand off and stand off, no tackles made. Just run up, stop, watch the player run past. Regardless of what tactics you use (i.e close down more, harder tackling etc). The amount of goals conceded by corners or long range wondergoals is a joke. Im in the Scottish Premiership right now, theres no way my team should be conceding the types of goals they have been. Whats worse - for some reason when i turned the match engine off and went back to the classic \"only commentary\" mode - these ridiculous goals stopped! I went the next season undefeated! I'm now persevering in my 4th season. With my team having 60%+ possession, 30+ shots, 8 on target, lost 3-1 to a team with 10s & 11s finishing. wtf?

This game is no fun to play at all and is incredibly frustrating. As most people have mentioned its buggy. The \"new\" menu system works for some things (quick access to teams, training etc) but is terrible in others such as the team selection (covered in colours and you have no idea how to even pick a team which results in a steep unnessesary learning curve). Then comes the matches, almost every game goes one of 4 ways. You scrape a win/draw. You dominate and go 2-3 goals up and end up loosing somehow. You thump a team 3 or 4-0 or you get thumped yourself. It doesn't seem to matter if your opposition is better or worse than you those are the outcomes. Mostly you will scrape a draw/win. to make it worse you can thump a team better than you, then get smashed by a team worse than you the next week! The team talks are basically the same, and as poor as the last couple of years but with an apparantly random outcome of mood in your players (until you get repuation which frankly is impossible). The same goes for press confrences which have mostly been poor and a time waster, slowing the game down, and having a completely unknown outcome. Now you have to deal with the press directly before or after a game slowing it further. Just give it to your assitant manager, even though they will say crazy things like Arsenal will win the league when your playing as Tottenham. It may boil down to having to choose you managerial type RPG style which is the worst idea they have ever had. It feels like cheating by giving yourself the highest stats but that is the only way to stand a chance. I don't want to think about my inner workings as a manager/head coach I just want to play the game! It may also come down to learning how your interactions affect the game, this to me is unrealistic and learing how to play a game isn't the same as becoming a better \"real life\" manager. The one and only positive is the new scouting system, where you need a good couple of weeks/months to get a full picture of the player/s. Though you still need to make sure your scouts are half decent otherwise you'll waste a lot of time and money. Its just annoyingly poor. I haven't even mentined the bugs as there well covered by other reviews. I've played the game since the days of Championship manager but this is terrible, frustrating, and worst of all it's not fun.

Worth a sale buy for football fans, but nothing more as the lack of new features and still-broken 3d match engine does not justify the full price tag. Detailed review In short FM15 is a decent game, if only for lack of competition, but is a weak entry into the series. First off new features; well...there aren't any really. There is no true innovation that once made the series great, and I've been playing since Champ Man 98. To directly quote the new and improved list on the box, the new features are: New user interface - which is done every year. New scouting centre - which is a mild tweak of the scouting network. More realistic player personalities - which is also done every year. Deeper media experience - which, surprisingly, gets tweaked every year too. So what have I just paid for? Apparently an updated database, a few tweaks and a new clunky UI. Just like last year. I think this speaks volumes about the game's development if the marketing team are highlighting these as the \"New and Improved\" features. Putting aside new features, or lack thereof, I'll discuss the actual features. Player personalities, despite claims of being improved, have regressed to the point of manic depression rampant in FM13. I'm getting transfer requests and complaints if players don't feature in every game regardless of form, fitness or squad position. I regularly play all of my senior players, being an advocate of rotation to minimise fatigue and injury, and I have regular players complain about lack of game time if they aren't in the first 11 for as few as 2 or 3 games. Players also cannot take criticism, or praise for that matter. I've criticised players with below 6/10 ratings and had them say they played well, and praised a 9/10 hat trick scoring player for him to say that he was disappointed that I thought he'd played well. Personalities don't seem to count for anything, all players seem to be Volatile in my game with a 50/50 chance of positive or negative reaction, whether justified or not. The match day experience hasn't changed much, except you now get occasional tunnel interviews and can give pep talks from the touchline. Tunnel interviews happen at random points and play out in the exact same way as media interviews, only you cannot seem to skip them or send the assistant. It is tedious and repetitive. However being able to give touchline pep talks is a great implementation, allowing you praise or berate players as needed to spur them on further. I'm not sure whether there is actually an effect or if it is just placebo, but it is a nice inclusion. The 3d match engine is unsurprisingly still broken, but unlike last year where I could only really fault the defensive AI, all aspects of AI is broken for both your team and the opponent. Missing open goals, passing to the opposition, letting loose balls run free (for both scoring and conceding chances), not marking, poor movement, even worse animations, players completely ignoring instructions, the list goes on. These issues just lead to dull games, whether winning or losing. Personally I think the 3d match engine needs to be scrapped entirely as SI have consistently failed to fix widely criticised issues. The workaround I have used since 2009 is to use the 2d engine, giving reasonably realistic performances and scorelines, and is still something I do in this installment. Out of match experience is incredibly enoyable. Updated FFP rules mean you really have to budget and plan for smaller or \"in trouble\" clubs, and transfer fees are still reasonably realistic compared to a few years ago where they would often inflate out of control as seasons progressed. There is also more interaction with players, such as being able to convince players otherwise out of reach or too good for a club to actually join with the promise of trophies, progression or captaincy. Most players also seem to be realistic about demands too; for 2nd and lower tier clubs I have signed some good players coming back from long term injury on reduced terms than they would otherwise be expecting. Summary: Overall the game is a decent enough football management sim. It's great being able to buy players, plan tactics and watch everything flourish. Where I am taking issue with the game, as I have for a good 3 years now, are the lack of new features and the still present broken ones. The 3d engine is widely criticised, and has been since inclusion due to poor AI, yet SI persist with it and never seem to fix it. It's reached the point where they should abandon that feature and concentrate on their strengths of simulating the running of a football club and player development. The lack of true new features is disappointing because there has been no innovation since the 3d match engine back in 2009. There is far more that they can do with the game such as being able to have some interaction with upgrading or building new club facilities (training centres, camps etc), how and when to upgrade stadia, creating new feeder teams in upcoming leagues such as MLS; personally I think that the lack of real competition has caused SI to become complacent with new features. The game just feels like an updated database of players with a new wrapper, yet for all of its flaws it still scratches an itch of running a football club. 5/10", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "bwfcnut", "date_updated": "May 12, 2015, 4:38AM", "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.8333333333333334, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "May 12, 2015, 4:34AM", "username": "Carl Sagan"}

I was top with Bolton, ten games later im 14th but every player still had good or better morale. I've always played football management game since the 90s, Football Manager for me is still the most unenjoyable one. - Too long still, way to much time consuming to get through a season. - Player interaction on it is best left alone (I'm pleased with your training level. Your club facilities are stopping me getting better) morale effected, performance effected, results effected. - Tactical importance on this game is way to much, you can beat Real Madrid then the next game, Walsall could dominate you, even win you.

My overall ratings for it (of 10); Time value: Could be slower, if I had a bad laptop it would be 1. 3 Tactics imput: Outclassed by lower league sides. 2 Team Talk efffect: Don't see the point in it, to keep morale up? It's a game not real life. 3 Enjoyment: Only when your winning, on Pes 2015, win or lose, it's still enjoyable 4 Transfer system: Trying to convince those 10 players to join me? Ridiculous, they was on 600 a week and so on. 4 My rating for FM 2015: Too time consuming still, unrealistic results, injury bug still even after year after year of FMs, near post corner bug, losing to poor lower league sides due to being tactically outclassed, I was doing well in the league, then I meet 24th place, I lose, I meet 23rd, I Draw, I meet 22nd, I lose, then in the Cup, I play a non-league side, 3-0 down at MY stadium, with a good decent paced. creative strong attack, good defenders 13+ everywhere attributes, 5 I'll still play it because it's football manager, but for anyone thinking of buying it, don't.

As long as they keep pulling tricks like this, Football Manager is a series that will remain evergreen. But the biggest improvement to this game has got to be the match engine, Year after year were used to the buggy disappointing experience especially for us 3D users, But from what i've seen out of my first play, Currently 18 games into my season excluding friendles i haven't seen 1 bug, Maybe i'm lucky but for a beta that's impressive! It's much more fluid and all of the new animations that have been added has really added to the realism, The new interface has got to be the biggest plus aswell alot more cleaner kinda looks like a andriod tablet set up with the left hand bar down the side, And even when you're scrolling down you're squad list or scout list it feels alot more optimized.. The game has improved big time on processing speeds, I'm running the same size database with the same leagues as before, England, Scotland, Spain, Brazil, Portugal, MLS, France and Germany and the rest of the leagues on view only with a player base of 92,000 which doesn't struggle, Which was one of the down points of FM14 although it was fast there was sometimes you'd be going to you're browser while you were waiting, They've also added a new feature where you can choose you're licence and past playing experience which i found to be pretty amazing, Although i haven't fully understood it yet but i'll be sure to update this when i do, I haven't tried Classic Mode as of yet, But looking foward to having a go at it hopefully they've improved it this year with less clutter and more stats! All in all i have to give this game a 9/10 which is pretty damn impressive for a beta! One last thing.. We still have leaderboards, Was getting scared as i was seeing tons of ruhmours about it not being in this years version but they were proved wrong, Hopefully workshop comes back this year too.

The tactic section is clumsy and very few things are better and alot of things are worse. Besides from that it seems like the match engine is way worse too. Normally there would be some sense of stability, but now i can play as Man City and win 8-0 against Sporting(POR) and then lose againt some 3rd division team 3-6 in the next match. There's an unbelieveable amount of injuries which is so damn frustrating. The search engine has got a makeover that is for the better, although i seem to have a problem finding young players from outside Europe without making the leagues playable. All in all a turn for the worse, but most of the problems could be solved with some updates and maybe a choice to chose the old tactics interface (please??).

This tends to be the case nearly every year and dont always result in an improved product The changes made this year have largely been pleasing, although in particular I am not a fan of the new tactics board. It seems like the information I need is still there but it is hidden behind extra menus and mouse clicks, generally creating what feels to me like an inefficient system when compared to FM14. The gameplay has remained largely the same and is familiar to anyone who has spent time with the series. The engine seems to have been improved in some areas and regressed in others, again mirroring previous versions of the game. There seem to be more goals going in, more goals from crosses and set pieces, and more defensive errors. The game also seems harder and learns an inflexible managers tactics rather quickly. I only use the 2D Classic view so cant comment on the 3D match engine, I have never used it or had any interest in it. Fundamentally, its still great fun to build and develop a team, to argue with other managers and to lead your club to glory or glourious defeat. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with more than a passing interest in the franchise and it represents a solid return on investment in terms of new features and gameplay hours.", "num_friends": 4, "num_reviews": 3, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 11, "num_groups": 1, "steam_id_number": "crawfs81", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 5, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.5588235294117647, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 47, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.44761904761904764, "num_achievements_possible": 105}, "date_posted": "Nov 5, 2014, 6:29AM", "username": "skeletonssskeletonsskeletonskele"}

Match engine has improved since the release with each patch, but again there is still room for improvement. Every new patch states that keeper reactions are fixed but i still fear every shot on goal and slow keeper reactions after the save. Everyone is complaining about tactical incosistency, how you can beat Real Madrid and loose next match against a lower league team, but it's good to change up your formation and tactics from time to time. For me at least it is something that i like and keeps me playing. UI is useful and easy to learn. Overall game speed is ok, i'm usualy playing with 7-8 different nation leagues and didn't experience any lag. I have no complaints on training and youth development. I don't like high transfer values and money spent for weekly/monthly wages but then again that's how it works in reality. Does it have that addiction spice in the whole mix? Yes it does, at least for me it has :). I've been playing FM (old CM) since i was 13 years old and now i'm 35 :). Is it worth 50 euros? No, it certainly is not.

This is my first review, which will probably show, but I felt I had to warn people. I was really looking forward to getting this game and thought it looked amazing when I first started playing it. The stadia and player animation are great, and the feel of the pre-match game itself is good. Training and scouting are easy to manage, as is the creation of friendly matches. Board and player interaction is fine, and I particularly like how whole team chats work. If only I could say the same for the rest of it. I am currently half way through my fourth season and am so frustrated with the game. I've given it a reasonably good chance (check my hours played... Not as many as others, granted, but still quite a bit considering the flaws in the game.) And here I am, sitting ***as usual*** with half my first team medium or long term injured. I've hired better physios, tweaked training to ensure that it wasn't too strenuous and ensured that my coaches were well matched to training routines. Still it's happening. I've checked others' reviews and plenty of people are finding the same. SI need to resolve this. The game is completely unrealistic in this area, and it's spoiling it for myself and others who have, sadly, paid good money for the 'pleasure' of playing it. The other big fault is the performance of goalies when the match engine is running. I mean, a 23 cap goalie with 17/20 for one on ones standing with hands on hips with Messi bursting into the penalty box?? Goalies with high stats for jumping reach and agility unable to reach a chest height shot from a marauding opposition defender?? A new update came in today, and I was hoping at least one of these two problems would be sorted. I played four matches against mediocre sides. 1-2, 0-4, 1-0 (woohoo!) and 0-3. I'm no FM tactical expert, but I'm not by any means a noob or a rookie. I've been playing SI football management games each year since Championship Manager 93 (yep, 1993 <grabs flat cap, pipe and slippers>), have in past games won plenty of back to back promotions, won European trophies and plenty of league championships. I buy players specifically to fit my systems and use their info to adjust strategies. My understanding of tactics can't be that bad. Of all the 20 odd SI games in the original CM/ FM series that I've played, this one is the most inconsistent and most frustrating of all of them. In the four matches played today, in addition to the 6 long/ mid term injured first team players out, I had injuries as follows: Game 1 - CM and WB both out 9-11 days Game 2 - No injuries(!) Game 3 - CM, CD and Lone striker all out between 9-11 days and 3 weeks each. Game 4 - WB out 6 days. Oh... and a training injury to my 2nd best WB - out for 2 weeks from half way between game 3 and game 4. Will probably have wait until FM 2016 before these flaws are resolved. People have been raising them on forums for months now and nothing has been done. However, SI's attention will most likely be firmly on thinking on the next game in the series. Unlikely that anyone from SI will read this, but if they do - remember that people have paid for this game, guys. I'm pretty sure that from what I remember CM and FM games used to be delayed until the match engine was just right. That was worth it. This time, it's been comparatively all looks and no substance, which is a real shame. For now, I'm going back to playing Champ Manager 93-94 on my old Amiga (anyone remember them??)... 18 players called Tadeusz Kruszinski and only English leagues available, but at least it had a match engine that worked!", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198017529259", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.8, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "Feb 28, 2015, 9:30AM", "username": "don.macleod01"}

HOW WRONG COULD I BE This game is beyond flawed , I gave it half a season first time round then went back to FM14 . I then waited for the January update and went back to it , To find the game slightly more playable only for without warning all the glitches in the match engine to return as soon as I hit November. First ever game with Southampton was horrendous. 4 pre seaons games and I lost Pelle/Tadic/Wanyama and Alderwield all to injuries of 3-4 months. First league game 2-0 up with 10 mins to go at home to Palace. Beat 3-2. There was obviously a fault with the number of serious injuries your team received , I was using all my subs to replace injured or players carrying knocks. My latest save with Lazio has been the final straw. First 6 games - Cessena (a) won 3-0 , Genoa (H) Won 6-1 , Empoli (H) Won 3-1 , Verona (A) won 4-1 , Juventus (a) won 2-1 , Parma (h) won 1-0. Now everything was looking fantastic my team were conceding very few goals , dominating possesion and chances created in every game and the players all seemed to be carrying out there roles as instructed. On top of that Klose was banging in the goals with 8 in his first 6 games. However it was at the Parma game that everything suddenly went horrendously wrong for seemingly no reason. I have to make 3 subs in the first 30 mins because of injury , I then change team instructions to \"stand off opponenets\" and \"stay on feet\" apparently that doesnt work and I receive 2 red cards in quick succession. Even going ultra defensive and playing on the counter with 9 men , I still totally outplay Parma but despite creating numerous chances all are fired off target or there keeper starts making wonder saves. I had also signed Victor Valdes on a free transfer so now he was match fit , I put him into my starting 11 in place of a mediocre keeper I did have. Thinking hopefully now i have a decent goalkeeper all should be good. Next 6 games. Udinese (a) drew 0-0 , Roma (h) drew 2-2 , Empoli (h) italian cup Won 2-0 , Ac Milan (a) Lost 1-0 , Torino (h) lost 2-0 , Palermo (a) lost 3-0 Only thing that seems to have improved is the reduction in Injuries to players during matches. That being said i know Lazio are in rome but training must involve swords and be held at the collosium as at least 5 first choice players have missed games with injuries picked up during training . Now surely this cant happen my team that was performing so well has now lost the ability to do anything. Klose has no goals in last 6. I seen penalties missed in the Udinese/Roma and Ac milan games. Players seem to be running in quick sand as the chase down through balls. And world class goalkeeper couldnt catch a cold, His positioning is terrible seems to run out and conceedes all his goals from nothing shots at his near post . The Roma game was nearly the final straw. I had led 1-0 and 2-1 and then watch Roma come back and equalise the next minute. Then go 3-2 up only for it be chopped off. The game is obviously full of glitches and bugs, And to make it worse these now seem to be creeping there way into the updates for Fm14 . Si games and Sega desperatly need to get there finger out and get these fixed as from what im reading in the reviews all the fans of the series are at there wits end with how bad this version of the title is. It does pain me to say this but avoid this game if you are a fan of the series or someone contemplating taking it up as you will be put off for life.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198033104587", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.8, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "Jan 28, 2015, 3:58AM", "username": "chris.nicholson"}

Read the SI forums. I bought the game which also had the new patch (so I was hopeful of these bugs being sorted). I wouldn't say I experienced a great deal of goals in my game (although I do play very defensive). I did however find that players were getting injured ALL OF THE TIME; during matches and during training. It ended up that I was making substitutions in THE FIRST HALF of MOST matches. Half the team will take knocks and 2 or 3 players on average will HAVE to leave the field due to injury. The last straw came in the Champions League, when I had done all substitutions (due to injuries - not knocks) and then My keeper and right back got knocks. My keeper would not move due to the injury and a goal was scored. I ended the game with 9 men.

A reason to buy a new installment of this classic. (Try the demo for free if you are an ex-addict like me!) TL;DR Summary: Player interaction massively improved Coaching during the match massively improved Match representation slightly improved (if they used CGI capture for those movements than they have a lot to learn) Tactical finetuning - massively improved Your profile as manager has a big impact on the game (Tracksuit or Tactical manager) Transfers are more immersive - players will actually ask for a transfer if a big team shows interest. Like the sound of that? Read for more: I bought every version from Championship Manager 2 (1995-ish) to Football Manager 2010. Then I bought 2011 on discount, 2012 on discount and 2013 on discount. And I realised I was stupid, I was basically paying for a database-update. A brilliant update, don't get me wrong, but the game never moved on. I skipped 2014 after playing the demo. I just wasn't interested and decided to go back to Championsip Manager 01/02 and try and safe Sheffield Wednesday from doom, the gameplay was basically a bit simpler but no less engrossing. I doubted about getting this so I tried the demo - and it worked, more games need demos! But aside from that, the interface has finally undergone a modernisation process, although at times annoying because you can't find things that were previously easily accessible (I tried to find where Jobs went for example). But if it had just been the interface, I still would have felt duped. There is more to it than just the interface, some of this might be gaming elements that were introduced in 2014, I am not sure because I never played that, So A few examples to augment the TLDR list. This is from my first two games (Wednesday in the demo and Wrexham in the full version) Interaction with players: Jeremy Helan, my French left-back is injured but comes back a couple of weeks before the transfer deadline. His first game he plays well despite not being match-fit. For some reason Olympique Marseille shows some interest in him and he requests to be allowed to speak to them. I calmly tell him that I will if they put an acceptable offer forward, they never did and he didn't grumble, instead carrying on. coaching during the match My FM Manager persona is that of a calm, occassionally passionate track-suit manager. In my Wrexham career that calmness got severely tested when in a game my right back (who had woefully underperformed all season) got sent off wrongly and we conceded a penalty against bottom of the league Welling. We were 3th in the conference and smiling. We go 1-0 down, but I keep telling my players to concentrate and we pull one back just before the break. After my central defender suffers injury after I used all my subs in the 60th minute they score another goal, very quickly. I tell my guys that there is no pressure and they manage to limit the damage (with 9 man on the pitch) to a 3-1 undeserved loss. The following game however my captain and central midfielder gets himself sent off in the 10th minute despite me telling my team to not go hard into tackles. He was just stupid. We concede in the 23th minute and I tell my guys to show some passion. We nearly score but... in the 34th minute my left back gets his second yellow card in 3 minutes. Again down to 9 men but this time against Gateshead, a decent team. They take us to pieces and end up losing 4-0. Throughout the game I have been telling them there is no pressure anymore, I needed to to manage morale. Following game (after fining the idiots that got sent off) I make some tactical alterations to fill in the gaps left by the banned players. But it doesn't work, Woking score in the 24th minute and we seem unable to resist. I change things around on the fly, pushing them all higher, encouraging them, telling them they can do it. And they do. End of the game we have won 4-1. I have never felt so immersed with the actual matches in FM. The animations are still mostly pointless (playing this on a low GPU power laptop though) but it doesn't matter, you can now really put your mark on things from the sideline more effectively than ever before. I might revisit this review when I have finished a few seasons, but I have to give this version a massive thumbs-up and, if you are an expired fan of the series then treat yourself to this one.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "TimDogg", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.56, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "Nov 16, 2014, 6:30AM", "username": "TimDogg"}

Read below and you will see i am a FM vet of many years. Sad to say this is the worste FM i have ever played the full release is no diffrent to the beta! My main issue is the relentless injuries and inabblity to sign players. I have 6 injuries at any given time, i started a new game with Man city and i have 9 injuries at the moment? I have not even had a chance to play David Silva as he gets injured every 2 seconds. The colour scheme is very poor and there arn't even proper badges for bpl teams? The action bar seems to get smaller and smaller every year. Si don't forget that the Vet players have used the action bar for years. We don't use the 2d or 3d view thats not footballmanger.... Players fall out with you for selling an uknown 15 year old with CF with 2 finishing? Whats that about? Its all just been simplified and not in a good way. Sorry FM i have loved you for 20 odd years but now i am falling out of love. I am bitterly dissapointed to the point of wanting a refund. I feel like i have paid 30 quid for a beta thanks :( Game developers in 2014 are taking us all for a ride. Bellow is my old positive review while playing the beta. If it wern't for the houndreds and thousands of hours i've spent playing football manager since i was 11 years old i may have achivied something with my life. I've been playing since it was Championship manager 2000 the season Luis Figo joined Madrid. I'm now 29 and living at home with my mum, Warning new players this game will take over your life!!! You will never get laid again...... Now to the Review... Ok so there's no badges for the English Premier League team's, but its still seems like an improvment on last years. There are a few new features and layouts to get used to. The screens have changed a lot Tac screen ect is completely diffrent, The News headline page almost made me throw up when i saw the relentlessly awfull, culours. Lucky you can change you landing screen so you never have to view that mess again. lol.... All in all after 3 hours of playing i hardly scratched the surface of the new features. Injuries also seem a little relentless, but i am hoping these will be ironed out after the beta. I hope this review helps. Ok i am adding in a little moan. I have done 3 seasons with Barca, and finaly have the transfer embargo liffted. However i can't sign anyone! I mean Juventus wan't 300 million for Pogba and he keeps saying he wants to join but does not hand in a transfer request. Also other players are demanding huge fees, Chelsea want 80 million for azplicueta? I am all for making the game realistic but i need to sign players at some point. The game is out today and i am now bored of it for the first Year in 20 i may be free!", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 6, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": 3, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198046791480", "date_updated": "Nov 9, 2014, 2:21PM", "num_badges": 2, "found_helpful_percentage": 1.0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 8, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.125, "num_achievements_possible": 64}, "date_posted": "Oct 28, 2014, 10:29AM", "username": "C.HugeTIts"}

I enjoy the managing of complex systems (huge fan of Crusader Kings 2) and can see how there is a rich variety of options and nuiance available. That said, the game is lacking in a clear entry point for the true noivce. The beginner difficulty/mode, as best I can tell, only adds small text notes with insipid hints like \"this is the sidebar menu with has options for manging your team\". After hitting \"use suggestion\" during the setup a few times (which was useful), you are dumped to a general game screen with 1000's of options and no clear direction. It is fine to have numerous tools at the player's disposal that they don't appreicate immediately, but you need to tutorialize the core game in some way as a starting point for them to explore and build off from. Instead, it left the clear impression that you need to go watch some youtube videos of other players for several hours to get the basics, making it feel more like learning a software interface than playing a game. I will, however, say kudos to the developer for having a free weekend to try the game out at no risk. The downside to this is that players will, on a lark, just try the game without doing a little reseach first. If this was something I was condsidering purchasing I would have likely watched some videos and incidently picked up the training necessary to play before experiencing it first hand. Please consider adding a proper tutorial if you are going to have a free-to-play weekend so people have a chance to enjoy the opportunity.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198043595629", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.6666666666666666, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "Jun 6, 2015, 8:32AM", "username": "Geugon"}

Make sure that you constantly take care of your team. And watch what you say because every action could affect the reputation of the team and you. I highly suggest you read up on guides or watch LP's of this game. Also ask the Steam community of this game for advice for newcommers like myself. It's an enjoyable game but really high on detail which is always nice to see. Lastly the online side of things I highly suggest playing with newcomers to get accquianted with the game together rather than having an expert, a familiar and a noob playing the game. Football Fans: This game is meant for the gamer who loves Football. This game strives to achieve what everyone who loves football wants to do. Run your own team. Choose your teams' style of training. Pick players, trade player,s negoitate for contracts and deals. It's really a good simulator for manager games. And if you grow tried of singleplayer action. Try online. In all honesty the online portion feels like a louge game just sit back relax and have fun. Speaking of which. This game isn't meant to be taken too seriously. It's a managment sim lol. Also with mod support, the game will become either better or more challenging depending upon your time of playstyle. Another thing, this game goes all out in terms of keeping you, and your friends in the loop through social media venues as well. The only real negavtive about this game is lack of updates. Now this could be because of the choices you made in the game. But even then, If a player is injuried i want to know first thing so i can respond to that. Another thing is that the \"mood\" system isn't all that great since the game doesn't really outline difference in mood apporches to handling player's the board of the team your representing and other teams, lastly the media. Do i recommend it? Yes i do, for football fans who have seen and pratically worship this sport. As for newcomers I also recommend it, however i do advise you do some research and ask people for opinions.", "num_friends": 327, "num_reviews": 85, "num_guides": 1, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 8, "num_groups": 6, "steam_id_number": "chaoticmayhem", "date_updated": "Jun 4, 2015, 9:18PM", "num_badges": 5, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.6666666666666666, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 62, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.8266666666666667, "num_achievements_possible": 75}, "date_posted": "Jun 4, 2015, 9:17PM", "username": "ChAoTic_MaYhEm"}

That was in early December. I still havent been able to get a good save going yet despite my best efforts. For some unknown reason, the better the club you choose, the more injuries you get. (Anything from 1-4 injuries a game in the Prem). Anyone who has played previous versions of the game will know that the interface has always been a bit boring but really easy and handy to know where everything is. In 15, they've taken into account the slightly uninspiring interface but have shuffled it all about really badly and you have to re-learn where everything is, the main top bar has been moved to the left side of the screen...it's just confusing. FM 15 takes their 'You will concede 2 or 3 in stoppage time' rule to the next level, its virtually impossible to hold on to a lead. It doesn't matter if your team has great composure, bravery, team work, concentration etc, you will always concede goals in the final minutes. Basically, if your team is 1-0 up at the 75th minute mark, you may as well turn your computer off. I was playing as Man City. On three occasions I was 1-0 up in the 85th minute. I did three different things each time. 1st game - I dropped back and defended my lead. I lost 2-1. (Vs Stoke) 2nd game - I pushed up and uninvited pressure, I played the offside trap. I lost 3-1 (Vs West Brom) 3rd game - I changed to a 6-5-0. Every player on the pitch went into a defensive position to block the goal. I lost 2-1. (Vs Crystal Palace) It happens 9/10 times. Fair enough but when it happens so frequently its just screams 'broken'. You end up losing your lead in a burst of sudden energy from the other team. What makes it happen? Its almost half scripted. If im ahead at half time I always think to myself 'It doesnt matter, ill still lose'. I downvote this game because it is simply against you. Not in a challenging way but in more of a ' you' way.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "danmayisgay", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.625, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "Jan 21, 2015, 7:52AM", "username": "NiallJenkins"}

I've watched my keeper and a striker out for a lose ball, the keeper is over twice as close to it and its moving towards him, he gets close to the ball then stops and waits for the striker to come get it then shoot past him. Some of the games are clearly rigged as well, just to test this, I saved a game before a Arsenal vs Chelsea game and replayed it quite a few times using different tactics and crippling the enemy team (all players 50% condition, Terrible morale, star players crippled), they still win 3-0+ repeatedly. Its an impossible senario..... Once or twice, sure, but 10+ times in a row? The player stats are just silly, clearly very little to no research has gone into them. Most of the players don't acutally perform best in the role they do in real-life. Finally, NOTHING has improved from 2014.... absolutely nothing. They have changed a few bits round, but that is all.

I went Into game, the guy tried to send me packing, telling me the usual nonsense that It wasn't bought there etc. Anyway, to cut a long story short, the guy phoned up someone (Steam maybe) and I was told to contact them with my order number/date etc. It's now been 6 days, and I still have had no reply. This Is shocking. The game was purchased on the 25/12/14. It Is now 14/01/15 and my game Is still not even being looked Into. Also, I have read a lot of bad reveiws/bugs upon researching ways to fix the sound. If you want to be treated like this, then this game Is for you.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198050776759", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.6, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "Jan 14, 2015, 8:02AM", "username": "j.taylor1980"}

Well i sort of rolled into FM back in 2010... which is not as long ago as some of you, but long enough to make a valid opinion i think. I really am glad that the time of cardboard public around the field is history, believe me. As is the time that the owner of the club you managed sold your players from under you, without even so much as a warning.... But thats realy all the positive feedback i have to give about Football manager 2015. Okay.. let me explain... I usually play FM when i wake up.. and am in no way, shape, or form, capable to play any action game whatsoever, being as old as i am... (almost 60) So I love to start my day with FM... to each his own right ?... Then you should know... I once was a rather fanatical Ajax fan.. started out at 7 years old... but those times are over since 1997... Ajax utterly ruined that... and destroyed their true fans in the process.. I still love the game though.. eventhough these days... it seems to me more like a bussiness with emplyees, then a sports club with players that still know club-honor, and real die-hard fans. that dont hate the rival fans to the point of letteral murder. And sorry to say... FM mirrors that a bit... and does that more and more.. But let me tell you first of all.. i REALLY HATE Mandatory. Something from my youth no doubt. And the mandatory team chat of FM14 was a sharp pain to live with... i usually did those with my eyes closed, and got out at the first chance i got... not even knowing what i just said... i just wanted out.... Now.. in FM15.. when you finally have a first team together that plays well.. players like each other, and you win more games then you lose... chances are that some damn SNOT-NOSE from the second or 3rd team comes asking for first-team foortball.. sigh. When you look at his stats... you just laugh.... I have been a footballer myself, quite some time ago, obviously... on quite a high level even, mind you.. I even played for Ajax a few weeks... before i failed the medical... but i wouldnt have dared to go to the first team manager and ask him to be in his team or.... ill be unhappy ?.... WTF ?... HA.. he would recommend me to cry a while on my mommy's lap.. or if that wouldnt be good enough... he would give me the number of a good shrink, and send me off with a slap on the back of my head... And quite rightly so... In past FM games i never gave them the time of day.. IF anyone was any good, his own trainer or my chief schout would tip me of on his existence or progress... and that was it... NOW.. in FM15.. it is MANDATORY to speak to this snotnose... REALLY ?.... Oh yeah.. i can decline... but if i decline.. chances are that half my team will be saying that i handled him unfairfly... and now THEY are unhappy... so gone team balance, ... ARGGGHHH... I AM IN CHARGE you ing overpaid brats... If you dont like it, go play in the reserve team for a while.. see if you like that better.. I will lose many game.. or get sacked.. because of that... but hell.. that feels so goood... And then i havent told you about, that if you have a really important game.. 90% chance your best striker will tear a muscle on the trainings field.. one or two days before the match... and will be unavailable... for 3 BLOODY MONTHS. Sigh... Oh.. and can count yourself lucky if your best defender isnt injured as well... Have i told you yet how many times one of our stikers is offside in one single game ?... 10723548303-times... thats how many.. Now... ill tell you... i've seen enough games.. been to games... and played enough games... to know that this is utterly unrealistic at best.. and plain imposible usually... and half the time its not even true... Nope.. no offside at all.. FM must use that as a ballance mechanism or something.. Listen SI.. get at least the bloody rules of this game straight.. will ya ?... And while you are at it,.. do your bloody research... When i won the club wold cup with Ajax... the game talls me this was a historic first time... NO IT WAS NOT.. Ajax already won it twice before.. first time early seventies... i think against independiente... not sure..., i was still young.. second time i remember welll.. against Gremio.. Blind made the winning goal... so this would be the THIRD time... Sports Interactive is slipping... in more ways then one.. so it would seem. About that offside... If my midielder launches a long ranged shot... it comes back from the opposite team keeper who could only parry it... and my striker scores from the rebound... It is NOT offside.... Thats a blatant lie... Then the whisle goes, and the comments say the whisle had already gone.... NO .. it did not... it just went... So even IF my striker was offside, your bloody whistle should have been going the second the ball left my midfielders foot... not a minute later when my stiker scores the rebound... You incompetent . Agh.... Then... Half my players look like in albinos... white as snow... very irritating... Nothing wrong with albino's per se... apart from that that i heard that they dont see too well... but i simply cant remember ever seeing a team with 6 albino players... on each side.,. Also players warp all over the field on occasion... which is rather immercive breaking, up to the point where it becomes utterly rediculus... so you can only play this game on the shortest high-lights.. Thank you Si.. that is some ing incompetant coding... Okay... I know... yes.. really i do.... you can not win all games.. That should be obvious to anyone... (Unless you cheat) But when spirits are high, moods at at top level... every one in the team is top fit and inspired to win... and this is in no way easy to acomplish... trust me... Then there is NO BLOODY WAY, that my team suddenly cant play football anymore... passes are 90% wrong, they miss most headers, they get yellow and red cards all over the place... No no no.... NO WAY... Sure.. even with everything good and in place... we could still lose the game.. it happens... but not with a team that looked like i just fielded a 3rd team of incompetant TODLERS.. Pfff..... Okay.... Those who know me, know i will always give you the truth as i see it... which, obviously, isnt the ultimate truth... what is ?.... but.... after having played FM15 for as long as it is out... and having played FM10 -FM11 - FM12 - FM13 and FM14 to death... i simply cannot recommend FM15 and live with myself. i simply can not. I love this game.., i really do... but i hate FM15.. still.. i do not regret buying it, simply because i have gotten so much pleasure out of the previous installments that i dont mind giving the folks at SI some donation... But i think i will go back to FM12.. when the game was still fun... and hope FM16 will be better... but i will no longer pre-purchase this game... So... as things stand.. i CAN NOT Recomend this version of Football Manager to anyone... unless you are a masocist.. So.. I am sorry SI.. but i simply can not.. Guys and girls.. do yourself a faviour.. And to be completely honest... IMHO... FM 2012 was the last superior game.... FM15, like to some extend 13 and 14, is one long big pester campaign... made to ruin your day and good mood completely... It is in no way any fun... and it will put you off.. of on one of the best, if not THE best football manager simulation games around... i am sorry to say. (Edit) I finally deinstalled this game, and reinstalled FM 2012... Now i can have fun and positive frustration again with my morning coffee. and all will be well..

Ive been playing FM properly since '09 and this visually is definately the most pleasing on the eye, although it is expected with most games that are in a series, each year graphics improve etc.. but ive noticed in previous years the creators talk about \"Our new and improved match engine!!!!!!\" whereas, in reality, it isnt much different but i have to admit, this year there is a difference. The '3D' match engine is actually really evident! Football manager to me was always a game that every part of it seemed as close to realism as it could yet when it came to the matches it just let the whole feel of realism down a touch. The players movement looks better, the shooting, passing, diving, tackling all just looks better, although i dont think they thought through the appearence of players that well.. e.g. Aaron Cresswell (West Ham Left Back) had ginger hair in my game? The interface of the menu screens has had a huge revamp, in previous years the interface had hardly changed and it kind of made me question in what is the point in buying a game that looks the same, just maybe updated teams (hence the reason i stopped buying FIFA) but this game actually looks like a new game, to a certain extent. The originial 'drop down bar' which is now down the left side of the screen is a great feature, with added tabs in the bar it makes navigating around quicker which for me makes the game more enjoyable, but that is just a personal preference. Im not sure if its to do with the game itself but from the last time i played FM14 until now i had upgraded my PC and bought a high-end graphics card so the general visual aspects of the game may vary depending on your own PC's GPU but for me it looks great, especially with the added Facepacks, Bages, Kits etc. The actual features of the game have been improved aswell, the tactics screen has had a complete change to selecting players and player roles, including new roles, which once i got use to the functions of it all seemed like a good way they have upgraded from the normal tactics, drag and drop & click 2 buttons, done. I havent played as much as some but long enough i think to make a judgement on the game and i appreciate that the game is still in BETA and will have some bugs, like 9 of my first squad players getting injured in pre-season and my CB getting sent-off 4 game he played in a row, but come November 7th on full release i think we will all have a fantastic game to enjoy for the next 12 months, be it if your a experienced FM player like myself or if its the first time picking up the game & if you are a \"Newbie\" little tip for you, Coaches will save your season! but anyway guys, work tommorow and its way past my bed time, hopefully we can all enjoy this new FM installment!

I'm half way into a Chelsea save and have seen a lot of injuries early when the players were out of shape, training was heavy and tactics were fast. After some tweaking they stopped. I am seeing overpowered crosses, Terry scores a hattrick! Some high scoring games.

Wake up SI, we're not Handheld here. PS: praise the lord that this sh*t is still better than EA's Fifa Manager.... . The second most important thing for me is the pretty low amount of team licences offered by the game.

And not worst as in its still enjoyable, worst as in its just not a good or fun game anymore. Something has been changed since those games that I can't explain. Sides with the best defence in the leage concede 4 in the first 10 minutes of the game; the top 4 teams in real life lounge around in lower mid table positions; youth players ask for wages of a consistent first team player. And the match engine, dear god the match engine. Players are clearly fouled but the referees do nothing. Players simply stand and watch as others walk past them. Tackles are so few and far between that I'm not sure playing defenders is worth it. And scores with 8 goals or more are not nearly as rare as they should be.

This year I decided to give it another go, desperately hoping for the same enjoyable and consistent expierence. Sadly all enjoyment has been sucked from the game! All I found was random results (I had pens in 4 out of 5 games), crazy dips in morale when and shocking injury rates. Everything I loved about it seems to have gone....

Despite my obvious love for the series, I cannot recommend this game/edition for this very simple reason..... Ideas: Good. Execution: Poor. The ideas/updates that SI have implemented into the game, such as expanded conversations and tactics are good in principle, but the execution of them has been poor to say the least. As just one example, many times I was presented with a response that caused players to react in completely the opposite way that the response dictates that they should. Even now, the injury problem hasn't been properly fixed, despite it being 8/9 months since the game was released. The AI/Match Engine simply cannot defend, and this isn't a tactical issue. The goalkeepers refuse to pick up the ball from no more than 5 yards away, and instead insist on waiting for another player to touch the ball before reacting to it. If you have FM14 already, then update the leagues etc using the many mods in the workshop and avoid FM15. If you don't have FM14, buy FM14 and just wait for FM16 to come out. Overall, FM14 despite having some issues of it's own, is a far less \"Broken\" game than FM15 is, and the problems that SI didn't fix themselves with FM14, the community has.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198038539976", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.6, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "Jun 13, 2015, 12:46PM", "username": "tingerz610"}

I went back to 2014 fairly quickly after the excitement of trying a new FM had faded. There are some nice additions to the game, but they've also changed what wasn't broken, and in doing so have destroyed the realistic play seen in 14. The match engine, with some new graphical additions off the pitch which are quite cool, is simply nowhere near good enough for general release. The redesign of the players and their animations is atrocious. If you can watch a match and not notice the hilarious arms of the players then you're lyring to yourself. This is more like an experiment with ragdoll physics than a football match engine. Players plod about the pitch with no real life in them, the ball moves poorly, and the pitches now look bogged down and ugly as hell no matter where you are. Tactics are not easy to really see in the match itself, nothing is realistic in terms of the way the team moves the ball, and that's on top of the horrible animations. Keepers are a little better animated, and as I mentioned the stadiums have more detail and things, but that doesn't make up for the core element of the game being so badly designed. FM2014 isn't perfect, but the match engine craps all over this one from a great height. Gone are the days of your lightning winger flying past his full back and getting a cross in, now they waddle around with all the urgency of a bored duck. There's no more slick passing moves that take into account your tactical instrucions, the ball now moves so slow.. and the poor new sound effect for the ball being hit doesn't help.. again, it just sludges around the pitch to no great effect. The colours of shirts and things are also far too bright, for no reason, this wasn't present in 2014. There are things I really like, female managers, extra things to say to players, a way to convince players your club is the one for them, the sidebar being more intuitive, and things generally being placed in area where they're more easy to find and helpful than previous. Working my way through pre-season I was absolutely enthralled with this game, until the first friendly kicked off and the immersion just vanished in front of my eyes. How pale are the really white players now?! They look ill! Arms are pathetic, tricks are pathetic, the whole thing looks far less graphically impressive than 14 which is hardly FIFA level to begin with. There's no excuse for this, and no way to return the game and spend the money on something else like both seasons of Walking Dead! Get FM2014 with a good skin and all the badges, logos etc. from the workshop and save yourself some money on this, checking back in October to see if they've reworked the engine, if not then I might have to finally say SI have lost their way.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 2, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": 1, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198161799618", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 1, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.5384615384615384, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 37, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.1289198606271777, "num_achievements_possible": 287}, "date_posted": "Jan 1, 2015, 11:18AM", "username": "forcefieldkid"}

Please note that my play time is considerably more than is logged, since I play mostly offline currently. As expected this version of the game isn't perfect. Some of the criticisms outlined in other reviews are accurate, however I must argue against a couple of points made. Firstly the match engine seems fine to me. I seem to score relatively regularly and concede a few here and there, as one might expect. It doesn't seem unbalanced from my point of view, but then I suppose I don't always expect it to work everytime just because I want it to, and rather I work on my tactics to make them more effective. Secondly, a couple of other reviews complain about the new 'confusing' layout. While I admit I had a hard time finding certain things initially within the sidebar, it really doesn't take long to get used to it and, indeed, I actually rather like the new look. This game takes the solid foundations set by Football Manager 2014 as a huge improvement over the problematic 2013 version, and builds on it. It gives a fresh new look, which isn't something I would have said it needed but now it's here, I like it. In summary then, from my own personal experience, this game is very good indeed. It improves in subtle ways on the previous entry in the series, and from what i've seen so far it doesn't really take anything away either. Make of this what you will, those people who complain might disagree with me, but then i'm not from the school of 'instant success or GTFO'. Buy it, if you are a fan of the series. I picked it up for a little over 20, and i'd say for the amount i'll play it, that makes it the bargain of the year.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198163122308", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.5294117647058824, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "Nov 24, 2014, 12:44AM", "username": "Blodmonath"}

This is the first year i have felt cheated out of my money. Where to start. the new side bar makes things complicated for no reason whatsoever. the old system was fine and didnt need changing, It might just be me but the whole feel of the game has a far more fake feel about it while at the same time trying to add an unnecessary amout of realism. I know this is a game but i somehow felt more connected to players and staff in the old one. then you get to the matches. The worst part of the game however is the god awful match engine. The players look like chickens with flapping arms, opposition goalkeepers appear to be the lovechild of neuer and buffon, whereas mine has all the ability of a paraglegic. My defnders seem to think that marking from corners means marking the corner of the six yard box and not moving and the guys on the posts are superglued there. I took charge of manchester united, incredible attack and i added well too, yet my team had no answers to the might of the mls teams on tour pre season, i went back over these games tried various formations and even went as far as using the in game editor to make all my players level20 on everything and still we were soundly beaten. this seems to be a big flaw from other reviews i have read too, as does the crazy scorelines, i managed to pull off a 7-6 win over southampton with their cb scoring a hattrick from corners due to afforementioned problems and another fabulous 8-5 win over qpr after being 4-0 up and going behind 4-5.

Takes some getting used to. -Injuries are a little over the top and excessive, so I'd like to see this get fixed or at least toned down. Seriously though. It's been a couple of times that I haven't even been able to reach the third game of a season without a little more than a third of my team being injured for more than 2 weeks. C'mon, SI. Cut us some slack. -Scouting is actually useful! -Still a lot of fun to make fun of other managers, too. -There's this thing now called \"team talk\" during a match where you can talk to your whole squad besides the pep talks. Doesn't do much, but it's there. -Keepers are dumb and rebounds happen on 90% of shots. -Incredibly hard to sell players. *IF YOU ARE NEW TO FOOTBALL MANAGER, READ THE FOLLOWING* I came from FIFA. Playing as a single player got boring and online matches aren't my thing, and I wanted a deeper manager experience, so I tried out FM14. And I became addicted. It's a hell of a lot of fun managing a football club with this much detail, and there are so many clubs to choose from that it's very possible (but kind of hard) to make a rags-to-riches story with either a single club or your management career. If you're okay with the shallow managing of FIFA, then you do that. No hard feelings. It's not like I'm on the development team. *IF YOU ARE NOT NEW TO FOOTBALL MANAGER, READ THE FOLLOWING* I'd say this is worth it over FM15, even in the beta state it's in as of me typing this. Just about everything is improved except for the amount of injuries that happen to your squad. Just be prepared to be fumbling around with the new UI for a bit as you get used to it. Trust me, it's a better, cleaner UI. P.S., this is a review of the BETA, so I should be updating this periodically. One more thing that applies to the beta and the full release (when it comes out): I really wish they could make this run in 64 bit as well as 32 bit. 64 is becoming more and more common place and it would make the game run a hell of a lot faster.

I have played FM 2013 quite regulary, its not perfect but its accessible. I have always made light of the match engine, yes it has its problems but it has never angered me to the point that I feel it's actively working against me. FM 2015 has some really unique in depth features, compared to FM 13 more 'events' happen between players, pre-match build up and the scouting system feel's much more accurate. The problem I am having here, is that I don't think I have really played enough to 'Review' the game, I just know that I have played enough to not reccomend it to anyone. Match preperation was a great part of the game, yet my formations are never trained enough in pre-season, even with a very high workload. I wouldn't mind if this also applied to the teams I am not in control of, it is entirely evident though that this is not the case. With time, I think I could become invested in this game, however the turmoil of early game problems has led me to return to an earlier version of the game for my FM fix. Just go and play an earlier version and save yourself the trouble. *Edit* After spending several more hours, I simply can't get into this game. Theoretically, the more accurate aspects of this years release should create a better FM experience, yet this is simply not the case. The plethora of new tactical roles just bemuddles the overall system, I really question if even half of these are used frequently in the real life game, especially outside of the top flight of leagues. I think overall enjoyment has been sacrificed on the altar of 'depth', if you want a tactical system which requires constant maintenance and player recruitment which takes hours of trawling through players and weeks upon weeks of scouting reports, I could possibly reccomend this game over previous releases. Also, the new interface is absolutely shocking.

I was hoping to get it on sale but I got so bored with my other games I couldn't wait any longer. Being a long time player of the EA FIFA Manager series (now discontinued) and a one time player of FM years ago, and read all the recent bad reviews I thought I was going in with my eyes open. I knew what I wanted in a football manager game and this one just didn't deliver - particularly on the matchday experience. Everything was cool to begin with, having to go for job interviews to get a manager gig, etc. I thought that was unique. The whole build up to match day was good, choosing tactics, and formations, etc. Its all very very detailed. I was quite happy to tinker for hours before I decided to plough through to a friendly match. Then I was presented with the most god-awful UI for match day, and a 1980's 3D rendition of a football match which I eventually turned it 2D mode because I couldnt stand it. For a game that has been around for how long, this 3D match engine is appalling. They would be much better off just having a text ticker for gameplay rather than a half-a55ed attempt at a 3D game engine. I hated the interface for actual match play. Way too much clutter, nothing intuitive. You could only have 1 or 2 widgets up and running at a time. It really hasn't been thought out well. I wish I could take the UI and match engine from FIFA Manager and plug it into this - it would be much more appealing to me. *sigh* another wasted $50. They do refunds around here?

You can buy/sell as you please as well as hire/fire staff as you please and you ride the highs and lows of football management. If you've played the older versions of this game this game is a slight improvement upon them. This version has added extra features and improvements which most are very much in the background. Truth be told the same issues with the preivous versions still exist in this version to a certain extent, such as the AI (at times in rare cases) is very frustrating and downright poor. AI issues have been adressed in the latest update, but much like many other games the orignal version was released unfinished/unpolished. Much like the FIFA franchise this game slightly improves elements such as graphics and adding one or two features which in my opinon is unacceptable there is alot of potentail and the creators should look to improve much more (Such as the match engine and overall media/player interaction). To be more positive the game is fun, challengeing and does feel like an improvement the match engine is getting better and the accuracy of transfers between clubs is better, however the next version must have significant improvement in order to prevent the franchise from becoming stale.

If you don't mind paying 12 for the experience then do so. Paying 25+ isn't worth it for me. FM13 just as good as this for me, but maybe they've improved the long term. It seems they've improved the big money on poor performing players so far though. Well this is my review after 4 seasons and 69 hours in. Maybe i should wait to write this review, as i'm only a few seasons in. Yet it still seems like a slight update on FM10. I think the only improvemant i've really ever looked for after FM10/11 is the long term play. With previous games when you got up to 10 years there seemed to be no big players regenning and teams making stupid purchases, then selling those stupid purchases on the cheap. I skipped 14 as i saw no point in paying new game prices for a DLC. Oh and i'm one of those bought every game since CM2 players. I got FM15 on the cheap, which is the only reason i bought it. Also i don't play in 3d, so my opinion is purely gameplay and not graphics. 2015 has slight improvements, but still falls back on the same old annoyances. You're flying high and beating everyone, but if you come against a bottom 3 team expect a loss, but not a 1-0 or 2-1. It'll be a 4+ thrashing. Yes i know it happens in real life, but a guarenteed 6 loses no matter what you do is unrealistic. I expect \"that's football\" comments, but it shouldn't be for 6+ games of the year against bottom 3 whipping boys. It's also guarenteed your top players will get below -6 ratings in these games. I play as small clubs and bring them up the leagues. In the lower leagues the teams towards the bottom suddenly act like they are playing a big team in a cup game. The goalie that's leaked 50 goals in 12 games stops every shot, the strikers that have 4 goals between seem like Ronaldo and Messi. Then at the opposite end when you get to the Premiership your small club, which is playing well comes up against a struggling \"top team\" you'll lose by 6+, but again apparently \"that's football\". If Liverpool, Man U/C or Arsenal will destroy you regardless. Much like the bottom 3 in other leagues. And the problem still exists with you raining down 20+ shots on target against a poor team, then when you finally score 1-5 minutes later the oppostion will immediatley score. The press still ask the same crap questions \"confidence is high\" etc and \"The people demand a response on your thoughts about a nothing subject\". I skipped a game year and these questions are still repetitive and pointless when i thought they'd been sorted out. Also managers can seemingley diss you now and you have no way of responding. If Tony Pulis says 'i'm a poor manager who is arrogant and my team doesn't deserve the plaudits it gets' i should be able to respond. Maybe i'm not looking hard enough for a tab to respond to him, but at the moment i can't find it. There could be so much more added on that part of the game. So often as the smaller team fighting my way up the leagues i'll throw a big contract at youngster or a loan offer. Then the response will be \"your team isn't good enough/going anywhere\". The next season i'll find myself against his team. If I beat them or i'm at the top of the table and they are at the bottom I shouldn't be able to have a dig. Which could result in his morale boosting or dropping. I can't seem to find a the old tab of \"comment on next opposition\". Instead of this you get asked about a youth player who left the oppostion when he was 17 returning to play his former team and how their fans will react, even though he was there a season and never played for them. Also something that's not been improved is players getting annoyed at you. I signed a player that was immediatley injured and out for 2months. When he returned i eased him in and he got injured in training and was out again for a few more weeks. He came back and before i could even ease him in he got injured...in training. So the next time he came back i eased him in again and he immediatley complained i wasn't giving him chance...i tried to reason that he was coming back from injusry he disagreed that i hadn't put him straight in to the first team(he was signed on a backup contract). I started him in the next game and he got injured. He still wasn't happy i wasn't starting him when he came back. This also happens with any backup players seemingly. \"i know i'm here as backup, but i feel i should be starting\". They are coming on as subs, starting cup game and getting games when needed, but that's not good enough. Even though they were signed as back up and agreed to this role! This happened in previous games especially with the injured playing complaining about not been involved. To sum up i really wish there was a neutral reccomend button. I don't feel this deserves a \"No\", but i also don't feel it's improved enough or maybe i've played enough to give it a \"Yes\". Like many you'll probably see me go well over a few 100+ hours. If i get to season 10 and new players are coming through i'll come back and say. But as of now i see no major improvements on FM13 just tweeks. I got bored in FM13 after trying to improve Scotland singlehandedly. Winning everything and winning the World cup apparently did nothing. The one advantage of playing in Scotland was the bottom 3 thing and small club against big clubs didn't seem to happen. Maybe it's just the English league that has that problem, so i might give that a go if i get bored in FM15. I defintley wont be gettin 16 or 17, as again I heard there were launch problems with this one.", "num_friends": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 10, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198003248470", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 6, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.5, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 0, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.0, "num_achievements_possible": 2}, "date_posted": "May 1, 2015, 5:08PM", "username": "Lord_Flashheart"}

Although it has been improved the graphics are poor. But if you aren't to bothered it then it's all well and dandy. For people that are new to this series you don't have to look at the pitch setting, you can easily turn it to 2D mode, which is good. Having clocked nearly 190 hours on this game since Christmas Day, I have clearly enjoyed this game in the 4 months I have owned it and would recommend this game to all fans of football and people who like strategy type games. If I had to rate it, I would give it an 8 out of 10. The game is enjoyable, yet can addictive at the same time, which could lead you to playing this for hours and hours.

The truth is though my baby is only five days old. I really just can't stop playing this game. You can do anything. Even when I somewhat get bored and decide to go find some other sports manager game I always fall back to, \"Well it looks cool but it doesn't have everything that FM has.\" and \"I've already made a career on FM and and things are going well, I just want to see what's next.\" Classic mode is basically the mobile version in my opinion, (Which I also own) It doesn't offer nearly the depth as normal. I usually start a save with one team but by about 4 years in I'm controlling a number of head coaches most of which I like to start uunemployed and work my way up the lower leagues. When I started playing I would always pick the top tier teams to start but the game's richness really come from battling it out in the trenches of some random country's pyramid with players who make less money in a two week period than I do. There is also no better feeling than when your 16 year aold wonderkid regen grows into a well groomed goal scoring machine and helps win a world cup for his country, leads your team to the champions league or sells for a $150M even though it hurts your feelings to sell him. The only thing I would comment almost negatively about is the in-game editor. It's not even a negatve really because it's awesome and if you really want to get the ball rolling on a team and have a dominating season quickly, move someone to your club you can't afford, or turn a no potential regen into a wonder kid it's very easdy to do so. That's the only negative comment: Be careful with the editor because you'll get too good too quick and get bored when there is no one better to buy. It's also very hard to stop using once you started.

I fully understand that Fm is a management simulator, and that SI will say it isnt meant to be FIFA'esque in terms of graphics etc., but that isnt my gripe. The major issue I have with the ME is what you see happening in no way relates to your instructions or the stats at the end. For example, you concede too many from balls over the top, so you set the team to defend deeper. But when you are viewing the match, the back four are still in the halfway line. What is the point in having the facility to change something if the ME doesnt reflect that change? Same with ratings; a keeper drops one into his own net then kicks a ball stright to the opposition to score. His rating is a 7. From what I see, he is at fault for two goals, yet if I discipline or drop him, he thinks its unwarranted as the stats say he played well. Nothing you see happening relates to stats. Some of the interplay is laughable. World class players look like baby deer trying to kick a ball and the decision making completely at odds with what players (especially good ones) would do in those situations. Only real benefit of th game its updated database. Aside from that its a poor imitation of previous versions.

Of course it's going to have some bugs/faults/issues with the game as soon as it comes out, just like any other PC game you buy, none are perfect as soon as they're released due to companies being pushed to release their games quicker so that they ensure they make a fast profit. You just need to be patient, like I was. Once the bugs were fixed and it was all how it was supposed to be, this is a really good game. Probably the best one out of the FM series yet, due to you have to actually Scout and search for certain player that you want/need. Instead of their being a huge list of transfer listed players available, so it's hit and miss on whether you get bargains or you end paying the full price. Which is extrememly realistic. The 3D graphics have been improved making it more realistic on the pitch especially with the new \"Team Talk\" feature allowing you to shour specific instructions to your team. The only downside is that Sega have yet again tried and failed with the Media, I started of as a Conference North Team (Chorley FC) yet i have press conferences before and after EVERY game. Surely a team that has only just made it to the Conference north, shouldn't be having this many Press Conferences/Tunnel Interviews if they haven't even been fully estabilished by anyone hardly? It just makes it seem like they haven't put much thought into the media. Overall I am pretty much on this game all the time now, it's extrememly addicting, I would advice anyone to purchase this.

I dont know where to start, The graphics are terrible and cartoon like (i have a top spec PC AMDFX8350 Radeon R9 series graphics) The injurys are beyond a joke, Im getting 3 or 4 serious injurys every game. The OI tactic screen doesnt work which is a joke. Said screen is now on the tactics tab but when you set the OI it doesnt do anything in the game build up beacuse you have to RENTER the OI anyway before the team talk.

Just remember that Football Manager until the final patch is a public beta and you'll be ok. As for the game itself, I played one season so far and enjoyed it. There were too much injuries, but it can be considered as a challenge (also rotation and young players were extremelly happy to replace crippled first team members). There were too much woodwork (but several FMs back it was much worse). There were some nice goals and dramatic matches. Overall, it was typical Football Manager experience  not ideal, but quite enjoyable. Match engine improved a lot  much less scripted goals, much more goal diversity (my player even won Goal of the Month Award  thing I can't remember since introducing 3D match engine). Still, we have a lot of morale goals during 46-48 min period, but I guess it'll never change. Anyway, you can have some fun with FM15 or die from a rage attack. Your choice.

You can see how everything is working allot more now and makes it important to have feeder clubs from different countries to improve scouting knowledge across the globe. Touchline instructions are cool in theory but i found it to be pointless and makes your team worse off, just stick with the pre match and half time team talks. Match engine is allot better and it feels more fluid with the animations however are there some dodgy stuff that happens especially when 2 or 3 defenders are trying to chase down a loose ball then none of them end up getting it and leave it whilst a surging striker latches onto it and scores when they shouldent of had any chance of getting it. The only bad thing really for me is the default skin but that's a personal thing, as for the game it's solid and a solid upgrade.

It is a game that like 2014 ramped up the difficulty and you have to have a team throughly prepared. You also have to be very careful in what you say, not only to the players but to the media. Morale has an impact in the games like 2014 and long streaks of losses can be brought on if you are not up to the mark in man management. There are some dodgy goal keeper animations that often cause goals (rare off the wall scorelines), and often times follow up conversations with players that don't quite relate to the previous conversation, but they are not exactly game breakers. The game has brought in a much more streamlined interface that I have found a very welcome addition. I have always found the News an irritaion and have waited for the return of how 2010 had the headlines away from the inbox and I have found 2015s way much more to my liking. The game is very enjoyable and one of the few that often has me making noises when goals are missed or penalties given, it is nice to get that sort of immersion. Setting up your profile as manager and being able have coaching stats and ratings to use in game are great, finally running the training yourself will have a greater effect. I really like it the positives outweight the negatives by a long way and have found it the most enjoyable FM since 2010. The game engine is good, the management detail is fantastic. The scouting has been revamped, I like the uncertainty brought in with vague ratings eg. Passing 16-19. I like that teams try very hard to hold onto their good players, for example I found a future star according to all my scouts, his value was below 1Mil, but the team he was with knew what I did and would only sell him for 42Mil. I recommend it, it's worth every penny for the management fan or football fan alike.", "num_friends": 34, "num_reviews": 54, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 9, "num_groups": 1, "steam_id_number": "76561197993632034", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 4, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.4, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 14, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.23333333333333334, "num_achievements_possible": 60}, "date_posted": "Dec 2, 2014, 3:45PM", "username": "Glendinho"}

As of Beta 15.0.3 most of those bugs were solved. Now I had only observed a few bizarre defensive errors and some excessive red cards, but I can safely say that this game will be proper in the release date. Good Job SI! There was some good additions as the RPG like feature to estipulate your manager skils and the possibility of team talking during the matches, not only in half or full time. Also I liked the new scouting system, its not only more beautiful and easier to adapt as it seens to be more effective. The tactical screen was also improved, its now more reallistic and fluid with some nice additions to the tactical options. I'll list the main bugs that affected this game until the Beta 15.0.3 and update their situation as SI realizes the patches. All of them I observed in all my 3 saves (Playing in Spanish, Italian and Brazilian leagues propositaly with top clubs: Real Madrid, Juventus and Cruzeiro): . LOTS of goals (Bizarre GK and defensive errors, lots of own goals). This was totally adressed in the 15.0.3 update. There still some keeper and defensive errors, but most of them seems acceptable as this is a football simulation game. Still, there are very few defensive errors (especially with wing/full backs) that seems a bit unrealistic. . Iconstancy (Long winning and losing streaks without apparent motives): As I've said, I'm propositaly playing with top clubs so, as of beta 15.0.3, I'm experiencing long winning streaks with some unlucky draws and some loses to stronger teams, something closer to what one can expect playing with these teams. . Bizarrely high frequency of yellow and red cards (3,4 or 5 reds in one game, all games of the round having red cards). This seems to have been adressed but still happens sometimes. I know some football games tend to be very violent, but having 3 red cards in two games of the same round in the Spanish League it still seems fishy to me. . Excessive player transfers demands and team meetings. This also seems to be adressed. Players now seem more mature as when to ask for a transfer and of when to call a team meeting, but there still some bugs, as when Llorente asked me a new contract and I promised to give him one in the end of the season. He accepted but the next day he was mad at me because I didnt agreed with a new contract straight away (And called a team meeting of course). Or when one of the younger players asked me for a transfer in the very first day after the window closed.

The pinnacle of management games for me was Championship Manager 03/04, I preferred the pricing of players and they eventually become disgruntled if left out of the team. This game though? I've left a player on the bench for maybe the first two or three games of a season only for him to immediately complain about not being in the team, it wouldn't be so bad if you could actually get away with a squad of 16 players but injuries are a big problem. I had one match were three of my players got injured in it, so it's ridiculous trying to please the game when you need a big squad but the players complain instantly about it without giving you much chance of rotation or they complain even if you do rotate. The fees every club expects for transfers is also ridiculous, your club can barely shift the players for half their value. Yet you try and buy someone and get milked dry, for example I went to purchase John Stones yes he's a good player with great potential but they were instantly expecting 50 million and shifted no lower that 42 million for a cash only deal. Now I had a big club and a 'big' budget but this was ridiculous, in the end I parted with 30 million and a player who I no longer wanted (who despite that was valued at 22 million). The upsides of the game is that it doesn't always operate like that, the injuries always come in bursts but you can get away with it throughout the season with good subbing and rotation. The transfers can be better if you can be patient enough to play the game, i've managed to force transfers by making a player unsettled and you can lower the fee although perhaps not that much. In terms of real bargains, you just need to keep checking the transfer market and i'd recommend shortlisting absolutely everyone you have the slightest bit of interest in. The game seems to pick a small handful of players off your shortlist and put them up for great transfer bargains. A big difference I noticed about this game is that if you play defensively and have great defenders and a great goalkeeper you don't actually concede many goals and unlike 2013 your 'worldclass' goalkeeper doesn't run 40 yards out only to get chipped by a Joe Bloggs. You also get a better return from your strikers and it's more realistic, in older games they were either scoring 5 goals a game, or they wouldn't score for about 20 games before smashing in 20 goals in the remainder of the season. I'd like to see more options added to the game, the news reporter replies in this are only a slight change from 2014 and while you can control your budget it's only by reducing your expenditure, other than offloading players you can't do much to actually raise money or negotiate any sponsor deals you just have to leave that all to the club. I'd also like the training to actually do more in terms of raising youth players stats while you can raise them, if the player wasn't already set to be a wonderkid he doesn't improve at all and even if he was a wonderkid he often turns out mediocre. I just feel the increase in stats is too slow, it takes about one season to raise a handful of attributes up by perhaps 1 or 2 points and they're likely to drop whenever they feel like it. 7/10", "num_friends": 10, "num_reviews": 5, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 15, "num_groups": 2, "steam_id_number": "Jonny_", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 12, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.3333333333333333, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 55, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.514018691588785, "num_achievements_possible": 107}, "date_posted": "Apr 30, 2015, 10:07AM", "username": "Jonny_McClatch"}

This game is an absolute must have if you are a football fan, especially if you enjoy the tactical side of the game as well. Personally, I love the tactical side to Football, and I love creating new tactics, creating and developing new clubs and making a whole new generation for the football club. If you like this sort of thing, with a hell of a lot more detail than a FIFA Career Mode for example then this is a must have! ~Pro's of this Game~ - Very Detailed Game i.e, you are able to manage the entire club in great detail - Lots of possibilities; you can take Forest Green Rovers to the Champions League if you really want :D - Very good training and scouting - The most realistic management game out there! Please note that these aren't all of the Pro's, these are just a few main ones that stick out. Feel free to comment anymore you see! ~Con's of this Game~ - Addicting. ;) Seriously, prepare to end all contacts with everyone to play this game. - Some bugs in the Match Engine, for example,  goalkeepers and defenders are a stand out example. It will frustrate you, it's mainly the corner defending that defenders struggle on. It will annoy you. - CAN BE SO FRUSTRATING >:( yet somehow addicting...? Feel free to add any of your own Con's too ;) Thanks for reading, I hope if you're reading this you found it helpful! And maybe if you were considering buying this game I seriously hope I swayed you in favour of this game because trust me. It is awesome. THANKS!

The stats for your manager at the beginning mean nothing as i won promotion with Sheffield Wednesday and the following season i was outside the relegation zone and looking like staying up (my objective was to fight against relegation) and they still sack me. Additional to this i was making the team money. This has happened to me twice with two seperate teams. The stats i choose at the beginning were for a top manager and there is no way a team in that situation in real life would sack a top manager in that position. The top clubs sign all the best players but these players would not be happy to be sat on the bench and not playing games at all, just not realistic). And the amount of injuries i am faced against, at one point i had 8 of my first team players out for 2 months or more. Like i said i do like the game though and will continue to play the gaem.

I didn't have high hopes for this year... I'm happy to report that I've been proven wrong. The new UI is great, with the Google style search bar, and easy to navigate to important information on the menu bar on the left. The whole tracksuit / tactical manager profile option is a great feature, and at lower league clubs, you're able to directly involve yourself in the development of players without needing to hire in un-obtainable coaches, but it doesn't feel like a cheat as you need to surround yourself with motivators, tacticians and probably a Director of Football. I'm not sure on some of the new staff role - not really sure what a Head Physio does over and above a normal Physio, but the Chief Scout is great in removing the micro-management of setting scouting assignments, but it would be useful to be able to override his assignments if you need to. Match engine looks good, but still seems to have some bugs - I'm sure my strikers aren't offside half the time it's called, and often find muyself screaming \"never\" or \"1-0 to the referee\" at my screen, but that's no diferent from when I'm in the stands on a Saturday :) Overall, this is a good version of the game, and has re-invigorated my love following a couple of years in the wilderness.", "num_friends": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 6, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561197981513282", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 2, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 6, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.16666666666666666, "num_achievements_possible": 36}, "date_posted": "Mar 10, 2015, 5:39AM", "username": "Sgt Blain Cooper"}

I havn't even played as much as I wanted to but 100 hours is still a remarkable achievement. There are some people with more than a 1000 hours I know, it's crazy. Bust that just sums up how addictive this game is. If you are new to FM it takes a while to get used to the game, everything looks so complicated and time consuming. FM is very time consuming, but that's what makes it so good, you can literally sit there for hours and not even realise it's been 10 hours and you havn't eaten. It took me a while to finish my first season with Arsenal (my supported club) because I was still learning FM. I was new to it this xmas, not the series it's self as I used to play the handheld version up to 2012 then I just stuck to FIFA, but after looking at it for PC I thought I would try it out, like I said before though, the first season is the longest, you know, your learning the game and it's mechanics, but after that you blast through it, in 100 hours I managed to complete 6 seasons, 100 hours seems like alot for 6 hours, maybe it is, but it's a very rewarding game. The game is semi realistic I would say, more realistic than games like FIFA but these are completely different games. Some transfers can be stupid and the agent fees you have to pay are obscene. But this does not take the fun away however does make it frustrating when you realise Rues has a release claus of 20 million but his agent fees are like 10 mil, which does come out of your transfer budget by the way. The tactic creator is spot on, the ability to chnage player roles, pick if they will attack, support or defend and setup individual and team instructions to make sure your players are palying how you want them. With FM I never fully got into training and he good thing is, you can make your assistant take charge of all training and match preperation so you can focus on the more important aspects like transfers and winnig games, if you wish. The match engine is suprisingly better than it looks, I really enjoy it, it gives you the ability to watch the games in 2D if you prefer or don't have the computer to run 3D. But that's no dissapointment, the 2D gives the game some nostalgia of championship manager with the dots moving around the field back in the day, good times. I wish they would add some way to upgrade stadiums and I wish they would have the proper Premier League licenses, besides this the game is excellent, I give it a solid... 10/10.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": null, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "brandnew07", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": null, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_possible": null}, "date_posted": "Mar 11, 2015, 1:09PM", "username": "Brandnew07"}

The game is a deep mineshaft of detail that can get you hooked if you like that level of detail but if you want to build Gainsborough Trinity from the depths to the Premiership within the game you are going to have no life outside of playing this game. The graphics are okay but not special on matchday (players do still wonder around a lot), the detail and depth are nice but you need time to learn the processes and where things are. I suppose the same can be said for most games but this has been taken to a fine art (or torture level) in this game. The last one of these games I purchased was FM10 and I refused to purchase another one until I could see some improvement in the match engine. Here I feel let down by FM15. Players running backwards was always a bugbear of mine. (Bug being the right word!). For me the depth would take time to learn and it may be worth paying the tenner now but having bought Train Fever I haven't the time at the moment for this game. The question is will it come on sale again? Probably not until FM16 comes out. If you have the patience, time and want to be a Football Manager then this could be right for you. For me I am undecided!

But with this being my 1st ever experience with FM, it took a bit longer to get used to (or even understand) what the heck I was doing. With that said, I must say I find this game to be very enjoyable. Im no soccer fan to the point I can tell you anything about any player, team, league, or competition. I just watch it; especially the World Cup & BPL. With that said, Ive learned a ton about soccer simply from playing this game. And make no mistake; there is a ton of stuff in here. The depth you can take yourself is beyond explanation. I have a challenge currently taking place on my work PC and a career in effect on my home PC. You will be busy making decisions; moreso than actually playing a match. And theres the fun of it. Its the wheeling and dealing that gets me more than anything. I always start from the bottom in any game I play. So I spend a lot of time working my way up from the lowest leagues to the premieres in FM15. You have to manage your squads, staff, finances and the media among other things. And if you like micromanaging, you will definitely enjoy FM15. Your board, players and staff can be real pains in the  sometimes, but it makes the game that much more realistic and challenging. Since my playing time, I havent come across any bugs. The game runs pretty smooth and the speed of the 14-Nation games I set up is pretty fast. No crashes to report. The 3D engine is pretty much rubbish, though. I mean, it isnt bad, but Lords of Football runs rings around FM15 in that department. And to be completely honest with you, SIs released version is pretty damn ugly. It looks too much like a spreadsheet. I hate it. Youll hate it. The over 2 million players playing it hate it. Therefore, you need the essentials. At the time of this writing I recommend you installing these mods to make this game shine: 1) FM 2015 FLUT DARK skin v1.8 or later. [makes the game gorgeous] 2) DazS8 mini stadium packs [adds team stadiums to the club homepage] 3) DNK 20145 Backgrounds Megapack [adds beautiful wallpaper to different aspects of the game] 4) FM15 Real Names Fix files from sortitoutsi.net v1.1 or later [self-explanatory and very useful] 5) Megapack TCM15 [Adds true-to-life logos for just about every aspect of the game] 6) Sortioutsi Cutout Megapack v7.3 or later [adds true-to-life player faces in the game] These mods work together to bring you a more effective and visually appealing layout to the game. The FLUT skin also makes it a lot easier to read the information given and brings more information to the forefront while reducing your need to hunt for resourceful information; whatever that may be.

I've played FM2015 since the beta, having preordered it, and the only FM I'd played before then was the FM2014 demo, and even then it was only briefly. The 1000+ hours of playing time may be misleading, though. I've read that FM is the sort of game that sucks you in for hours and hours (like all other games designed around regularly fulfilling various tasks and then clicking--just one more time--to advance a turn) but one of the main draws for me is that I can \"play\" FM while multitasking on everyday work. I just keep it running almost all day and, whenever I have a break, I click open the window, do what I need to do, advance a turn, and go back to my work as that turn simulates. Sure, there are times when I find myself returning to the game much more often than allows for productive work--one way I'm able to realize this is when I keep returning to the game only to find it still simulating the last turn I'd clicked to advance--but at this point in my life, when I have a lot of projects to do throughout the day, I really appreciate a game that I'm not forced to sit down and focus on 100% each session. One major reason why I'm able to play FM so casually, I think, is because I primarily play Football Manager Classic. I started out playing FMC since the beta, figuring I should start out with that mode based off what I'd read and what the game told me. That original save ended up lasting me 5 months, spanning 20+ in-game seasons. After I felt I'd accomplished enough in that save, I tried out a few different saves in both FMC and the full game, but the only ones that stuck were in FMC. For one, I tend to \"Instant Result\" all my matches, which I know is possible in the full game if you use a skin that unlocks that button, but I don't want to go through that trouble I guess. I've tried playing out all the matches in a full game save before, and as exciting and immersive as that can be, not to mention how much more personal your players seem to you that way, it just takes way too much time, an affordance I don't have for one video game in an ocean of so many others. I also much prefer FMC's streamlined scouting system, as I'd rather just assign my scout to various countries or competitions than micromanaging everything that scout should look for and when. I'm not so opposed to the rest of the full game's micromanagement, as I think it allows you to sufficiently delegate the rest of your responsibilities if you prefer. I play FM to assemble a team of my own and create and use tactics to guide that team to victory; I don't feel the need to manage much beyond that. That said, there are two features in the full game that I wish could carry over to FMC--maybe in FM2016? First, and this may seem minor, I wish I could suggest/choose from a recommended shortlist of affiliated clubs in FMC like I can do in the full game. Especially as players experience more of the world of soccer and the many clubs that inhabit it, I think it's natural for them to have opinions on those clubs, including which ones they'd like their own club to have an affiliation with. I also think that making available this sort of choice would add to players' roleplaying experience, building upon the vision they have for the club they (mostly) have control over. Second, I would LOVE an FMC database editor. I'm pleased that I can mod the uniforms and logos in FMC through universal .xml files and images, but I want to mod clubs and competitions as well--and play others' mods! The only reason I even tried a few full game saves is to be able to play mods. I was pretty bummed when I realized I'd have to sacrifice much of what makes FM so appealing to me (i.e. FMC) in order to play these mods that seemed so intriguing. I know there are plenty of reviews out there for FM2015 that touch on all its new features, along with summing up the game in general for potential new players, so I decided my own review would be different by focusing exclusively on my own experiences with FM2015. I hope some of the things I mentioned resonated with you, maybe even enough for you want to join one of the most enduring game communities online too.", "num_friends": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 13, "num_groups": 3, "steam_id_number": "76561198048886094", "date_updated": "Jun 17, 2015, 12:18AM", "num_badges": 12, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 60, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.5714285714285714, "num_achievements_possible": 105}, "date_posted": "Jun 17, 2015, 12:13AM", "username": "Sarkany"}

It isn't perfect, but you'll get mileage from it. I would recommend this annual update if you haven't bought the last 1 or 2 Football Managers. If you have bought them all, like me, then you probably don't need a review. I wouldn't say that it is flawless though. Players seem to pick up injuries and knocks that put the out of the current game a little too often when compared to my watching of football out in the wilds of real life. Maybe that's because I start with low league teams, however, and may improve with the skill of my staff in later game play. I also find it frustrating that you can employ staff to delegate tasks to, but then find that the most simple tasks evade them. For example I had a director of football who continued to sign players even though we were already over our clubs wage limit. I can avoid this by either not recommending players or by leaving the contract signing to me, but it feels like a waste of time to delegate only part of what a staff member's role should be to that staff member. Again this might be because I start at low league (English Conference South), but it seems a bit awkward that they can't even do basic sums. The rest of the game is tight and I enjoy the micromanagement of the team, right down to the training. I also find some information into the development of the players easier to navigate to than before. I could probably write a lot more, but I find online reviews easier when they are terse and to the point.", "num_friends": 42, "num_reviews": 12, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 15, "num_groups": 2, "steam_id_number": "TastyRadiSkull", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 15, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 21, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.03471074380165289, "num_achievements_possible": 605}, "date_posted": "May 18, 2015, 2:34PM", "username": "TastyRadiSkull"}

Football Manager 2015 offers a lot of detail. The sheer number of stats, positions, tactics, players, teams, leagues, stadiums, etc., etc., is daunting. The steep learning curve and poor explanations in-game of the mechanics and options (despite the numerous tooltips) make the first season or so difficult for a newcomer to the series. Once you have a handle on some of it, it becomes quite enjoyable to plan out a season and execute to your plan. I had more than one moment during a match when I was as excited to see my players score a goal as I am when I'm coaching a real life game. Finding a good prospect or molding a young player into a star is also rewarding as is finishing a season at the top of the league or being named coach of an all-star team. On the other side of things, the game has some quirky behavior and although it appears that many of the bugs with injuries and match AI have been fixed since release, there are still some head-scratchers. More than once I've had a player complain about not playing enough first-team soccer before the first game of the season (and this for players that joined in the first transfer window of the season.) The dialogue system is an odd mix of mood and phrases that don't mesh (and the reaction to them is often hard to calculate.) My assistant coach suggested that I drop a player who had just been named player of the year because there is another player on the team with better stats that can play the same position. My youth coach wouldn't agree to a salary that was below the maximum set by the board when I made the offer, but did when the AI (general manager) handled the transaction. That same coach then retired as soon as the next year started. One of my players threatened to leave the team unless I promised that we'd win the league that year, but then didn't believe we could even though we had just been declared the top of the league the day before. There's also a bit of an issue inherent in the way the in-game players view their own progress: as I took them from young inexperienced players into league winning stars, they wanted to move to bigger and better clubs and payrolls. If allowed to pursue their dreams, the rest of the team gets angry for letting them leave, but if you make them stay, the player gets angry and starts underperforming -- morale plays such a big role, that this makes you lose and cause everyone else to be unhappy, which leads to more losing, and on, and on. It's very circular. Overall the game should please strategy and simulation fans that have any interest in soccer/football or fantasy sports -- especially those with a fondness for spreadsheets and budgeting and a tolerance for repetitive and nonsensical press conferences.", "num_friends": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 12, "num_groups": 1, "steam_id_number": "76561198016208388", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 9, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 71, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.8068181818181818, "num_achievements_possible": 88}, "date_posted": "Jun 10, 2015, 3:27PM", "username": "Correndel"}

Simply put, I LOVE this game!! As I said, I've always been a fan of sports games (mainly NHL and FiFA) and while I loved the online competition, I also really liked to manage my team, trade/buy players, arrange your lineup and strategy ect. Heck, I could spend hours just trading players (or trying to anyways), resigning them, scouting out potential new additions and whatnot. Thru all this, believe it or not, I'd never heard of FM (in my defense, I'd been playing exclusively on consoles for the last 6-7 years) So when I found Football Manager, a game that is precisely about the management aspect of the team, I jumped on the bandwagon and boy am I glad I did. I love how much control it gives you over a team. I mean, contracts, training, transfers, tactics, name it, its there, and in great detail. Contracts have a bunch of clauses this canadian had never hear of, tranfers are not as easy and simple as you'd think sometimes, and tactics can be tweaked/adjusted to your heart's content! There aren't many things more satisfying than taking a lower league team and, with careful management and ambitious transfers, turning them into a top flight powerhouse who challenges for the league and Champion's Cup year after year! One of the downsides tho, is that when you do manage to raise a lower league club to glory, it seems the chaiman and/or board don't ajdust their mentalities quite accordingly. Therefore, I've won the BPL twice in a row with Fulham now, coupled with a Champions League trophy and various Cups/Shields etc. and I'm still making around 45-50k a year and the board doesn't want to expand our new stadium (3 yrs old) of 36.5k capacity even though attendance is through the roof and the club are raking in decent profits and are atop the club value table. Another le is the sim engine, who will sometimes decide to decimate your team with injuries, which isn't as bad as early on, thanks to updates, but I did have to use up all my subs in the first half once because three players went down. I mean SERIOUSLY?!?? And they were all in the 90% fitness range too boot. It will also make your players miss an absurd amount of scoring chances, with the very occasional highlight reel strike from 30 yards strike and exremely rare bicycle kick going in.

Simply put, I LOVE this game!! As I said, I've always been a fan of sports games (mainly NHL and FiFA) and while I loved the online competition, I also really liked to manage my team, trade/buy players, arrange your lineup and strategy ect. Heck, I could spend hours just trading players (or trying to anyways), resigning them, scouting out potential new additions and whatnot. Thru all this, believe it or not, I'd never heard of FM (in my defense, I'd been playing exclusively on consoles for the last 6-7 years) So when I found Football Manager, a game that is precisely about the management aspect of the team, I jumped on the bandwagon and boy am I glad I did. I love how much control it gives you over a team. I mean, contracts, training, transfers, tactics, name it, its there, and in great detail. Contracts have a bunch of clauses this canadian had never hear of, tranfers are not as easy and simple as you'd think sometimes, and tactics can be tweaked/adjusted to your heart's content! There aren't many things more satisfying than taking a lower league team and, with careful management and ambitious transfers, turning them into a top flight powerhouse who challenges for the league and Champion's Cup year after year! One of the downsides tho, is that when you do manage to raise a lower league club to glory, it seems the chaiman and/or board don't ajdust their mentalities quite accordingly. Therefore, I've won the BPL twice in a row with Fulham now, coupled with a Champions League trophy and various Cups/Shields etc. and I'm still making around 45-50k a year and the board doesn't want to expand our new stadium (3 yrs old) of 36.5k capacity even though attendance is through the roof and the club are raking in decent profits and are atop the club value table. Another le is the sim engine, who will sometimes decide to decimate your team with injuries, which isn't as bad as early on, thanks to updates, but I did have to use up all my subs in the first half once because three players went down. I mean SERIOUSLY?!?? And they were all in the 90% fitness range too boot. It will also make your players miss an absurd amount of scoring chances, with the very occasional highlight reel strike from 30 yards strike and exremely rare bicycle kick going in. Other than that, nothing significant really brings down this gem of a game. Couple it with a decent face/logo pack to make it look more realistic, and the FM Editor and a custom skin amidst the vast array of choices for a truly customized experience and you'll be all set for countless hours of fun!", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 1, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 1, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198169081681", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 1, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 19, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.168141592920354, "num_achievements_possible": 113}, "date_posted": "Jun 22, 2015, 7:21PM", "username": "Y0sh1"}

Also, if you thought this game had any semblance of defensive players actually doing anything other than scoring own goals or watching players walk right passed them you are in the wrong place. I realize this is the beta but the release is in 4 days and I don't see them fixing that many problems with a comlpetely broken game. I'll play it again on release and the next patch but I'm back to FM 2014 (not much better) until then. Will update review upon full release and/or next patch. EDIT: Next game after writing this review I had 3 players injured during the game. This takes my total to 19 injuries before the season even begins. My reserve squad is nothing but loans and more injured players as well. Maybe that's just bad luck but seriously how can this many people be injured long term all at once?!? UPDATE: Upon playing the full release I can officialy say that the defense is still terrible and starting a new save fresh for the release has resulted in 9 injuries before the end of the preseason with Crewe Alexandre. So I am no longer playing the 'beta' and as I guessed the problems have still not been sorted out. Guess I'll just be waiting until they patch more to start again.

All in all, it's still a good game, just like the last version, nothing special has changed and I'd recommend most people stick to the previous version and just update their data.", "num_friends": 3, "num_reviews": 5, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 1, "num_groups": 5, "steam_id_number": "Adaroo", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 2, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.42857142857142855, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 80, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.15444015444015444, "num_achievements_possible": 518}, "date_posted": "Nov 1, 2014, 11:33PM", "username": "Adaro"}

I finally managed to get ahead in a game and one of my players was sent off so I lost. It sort of seems like they want to make it as difficult as possible. They just need to tone it all down a little bit, and it should be fine. I mean, one player I was against scored 4 in the first half. I mean Liverpol are bad the moment, but I think it is slightly unrealistic for Abel Hernandez to get 4 against me in the Capital One Cup in less tha 45 minutes. Never mind, I can focus on the league.

Theres been to many times when the ball is in the box and the strikers or defence dont really do anything about it too many realistic goalscoring chances missed. 3.

Also, about realism, certain tactics automatically work with any team, even though they make no sense at all, or always fail even though they have been proven to work well in real life. Just look at the tactics uploaded to the Steam Workshop. There are things like 2-5-3 or 3-4-3 which would fail horribly in real football, but work in this game because they exploit the weaknesses of the programming. It's not all negatives, though. Outside of matches, the game is excellent. The level of detail in transfers, contracts, training, player interaction, etc. is amazing.

Much like it's predecessor, FM2015 is an evolution of the series rather than a revolution. This is both a bad and a good thing. The main differences between 2014 are mainly numerous small things that I will not mention here. I will mention the two things that stand out to me however. 1.) Match Engine: This has been in my opinion, greatly improved. Matches seem to flow better, there are far more moves, goals scored seem mutch more varied and over all it makes it harder to predict the outcome of a move (something I found I could do with previous Match Engines due to having seen the same \"move\" over and over again). Overall I think this is the best 3D match engine they have released. 2.) Layout: For some reason they have decided to completly change the layout and all the menu's etc. This is still p*ssing me off as the changes seem illogical and now takes me much longer to go to screens than before. I can see no reason for the change apart from for changes sake. It doesn't make things easier or quicker or more intuitive and generally just slows things down as it can take awhile to dig into sub menu after sub menu to look for the page you want. For existing FM2014 fans this may not have enough of a change to warrant a full price purchase but for players of older versions or new players I think the updated Match engine do warrant the game for consideration. Overall I do recommend the game as overall I find the FM series to be excellent, however note there are not a massive amount of changes compared to the last release.", "num_friends": 41, "num_reviews": 17, "num_guides": 1, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 11, "num_groups": 10, "steam_id_number": "76561198004686603", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 7, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 38, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.3619047619047619, "num_achievements_possible": 105}, "date_posted": "Mar 14, 2015, 9:14AM", "username": "Nevan"}

Played the free weekend and based on that short time there are some improvements in areas such as layout and graphics. The only slightly annoying thing I came across was when I had a friendly cancelled against a chinese side and I could only pick a replacement friendly from minor chinese sides not anywhere else as I could in FM14. In the time that I played I didn't have any injury problems but didn't get enough games in to test that properly. Still a few quirks in match play but no worse than FM14 though unfortunately no better either. Personally apart from the updated squads I didn't think it was worth upgrading from FM14 and have decided to wait until FM16 comes out (on sale and fully patched of course). I've still given this a recommend as if you haven't got FM14 then it's still a good game and highly adictive.", "num_friends": 2, "num_reviews": 3, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 4, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198028921242", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 3, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 73, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.6759259259259259, "num_achievements_possible": 108}, "date_posted": "Jun 12, 2015, 9:45AM", "username": "Spelunker"}

Addictive (You just don't get bored) Challenging (It's much more challenging than in recent years) Interactions (It's nice to see much more options in interviews) 3D Match Engine (Yeah it's got it's problems, explained below, but it's still good) New UI Design (The new user interface is so much easier to navigate, give it a couple of hours and you'll never want o go back) Cons - 3D Match Engine (The only reason it's a problem is if your tactics aren't good enough it makes the players make stupid mistakes and can be quite unrealisitic and frustrating. But if it was 2D it wouldn't be as bad just because you can't see the mistakes as much. Just get your tactics right. Match Engine (So hard to defend, so easy to score. Expect LOTS of high scoring games for no reason) Crashes (This has happened 3/4 times since I got it on the 29/10 happens at any time, hope it gets sorted soon.

You can't just make a tactic and throw players together without them playing together for a couple of months regularly.

It have a nicer design, is more realistic, they have improved the player market (still, more work should be done on this) and the game is faster to sim!

What I really miss is an option to FAST simulate championships as EHM 2007 give you as an option. I prefer to lost a little (and also more) of info, but be able to sim a World! However, this year the game as improved much in this sense. You still have to be able to play on a nice system, but I'm currently sim all the default teams, excepts from Asia, with a small Database, and the game seems \"smooth\".

It have a nicer design, is more realistic, they have improved the player market (still, more work should be done on this) and the game is faster to sim! I always liked sim games, but I think the BETTER game by SI was EHM 2007. This because it was funny, great (still best hockey sim/management game on the market!) and REALLY FAST. I don't really understand why they give you all the rosters, teams and championships of the world, if you cannot select more than 10-15 of them (with the rest of the world that remain \"silence\": no players, no offer for your players...). What I really miss is an option to FAST simulate championships as EHM 2007 give you as an option. I prefer to lost a little (and also more) of info, but be able to sim a World! However, this year the game as improved much in this sense. You still have to be able to play on a nice system, but I'm currently sim all the default teams, excepts from Asia, with a small Database, and the game seems \"smooth\". I don't know if can be worth to add Asia and Mods for new championships, as the game suffer from a great \"deterioration\" of sim's speed if you play with more of 120000 players (140000 are still good).

The amount of injuries I got a season appear to be just below the average in real. So I must say this is quite good. The amount of own goals has been a big complaint aswell but compare it with the amount the average top team of each league gets it is just a bit more than in real. That is mainly because in real they dont count everything a own goal that has been last touched by a defending player while FM 2015 does.

Its not a perfect game, I think if the developers spent more time and effort on it then the game could be what it should be in the year 2015 after the 23 years of product development time they've had since I first played CM on my amiga 500 back in the day, Not to get to long winded - In my opinion its the best version I've played yet but it should have been this good in 2001. Pro's - Steam workshop, fast gaming experience relative to previous versions, lots of options, not neccessarily overly complicated, match engine is capable of the beautiful game at times and does manage to elicit strong emotions in me, did I mention steam workshop? Cons - GKs sometimes go mindless for a few seconds in match engine leading to fantasy breaking silly goals this happens maybe once every three games, -Having to always watch the kick offs and final whistle highlights in match engine even if nothing interesting happens, -About once a game in the match engine a pointless highlight will show and last too long even though nothing interesting is happening.", "num_friends": 5, "num_reviews": 4, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 3, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198064070698", "date_updated": "Dec 13, 2014, 3:35PM", "num_badges": 2, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 0, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.0, "num_achievements_possible": 145}, "date_posted": "Dec 13, 2014, 3:32PM", "username": "Scarfell"}

It's a little better with the newest patch but a lot of things still dont matter. - The teamspeeches dont seem to do anything or you get negative results from it even though the game says you should say that to them. - Clubs controlled by the game buy up all of the best players and then dont even let them play, making it very diffecult for you to create a team that can win big prices. The players how go to those clubs and the after a year are put on the transferlist dont want to move to your club because they are playing at a better club even though they didnt play a single match. - Scouting uses a system where you can see what percentage your knowledge of a player (0-100%) is but there is no option in the scoutingmenu to say 'Scout to a 100%'. And even then at 100% sometimes the players potential still isnt completly scouted. - When asking the board to raise the salarycap for staff members it gets raised by 200 Euro's which isnt nearly enough to get any improvements. - Whenever one of your players get injured during a match its never the games fault. It never gives itself a red or even a yellow card. But you get red cards constantly. - Still cant reload my save during matches. It's an offline single-player game. If I want to reload my save during a match who cares. These are the main problems.

Reviews from the fans didn't seem very positive and as this game has a great community and fan following I was quite shocked. the main criticism has been the frequency of injuries. From what I have seen this is not even true! If anything i've seen fewer injuries than in previous versions. I have been looking closely to see this so called injury problem yet i've never seen more than two key players being injuried at one time and not even for very long! It's overall a great and addicting game and my favourite yet if i'm honest. However, the match engine, although improved, is quite poor and freak goalkeeper mistakes don't seem all that freak anymore as they occur quite a few times each season. However i'm pretty sure the match engine isn't much to go by (the commentary sometimes says completely different things to what the match engine shows - e.g player shoots really wide but the commenary claims it was almost in) this isn't much of a problem in all honesty and if you had commentary on only you wouldn't ever notice. The new menu layout is really good in my opinion and finding what I want to do is now much easier and quicker making me actually pay more attention to tactics, training and scouting (which I have often ignored to a large extent in previous games) Overall I'd say this game is great and the series is still going strong.

There are also some improvements regarding press conferences, they are shorter compared to FM14 and the question variety is greater. Touchline team talks was also a good addition and the overall general layout is technically easier than FM14. Saying that though, if you are an experienced FM player be prepared to take a while to get used some minor details, such as making a player avaliable to the under 21 squad is under the development tab instead of a squad tab. The 3D match engine is slightly better, however sometimes the goalkeepers do not behave like real goalkeepers in the 3D match engine. not diving, sometimes the keeper slides across on his two feet to save a shot instead of diving, other than that it is an improvement. However, the game by default does not have badges or logos or many player faces, you have to download that yourself. The tactics are technically more straight foward, if your new to FM you may find them easier compare to previous FM's. However, if you are experienced it will take a while getting used to the changes. To conclude, I would reccomend the game, however it is not a big improvement to 14 and it may perhaps be better to wait for 16 or wait for more updates, however if you do decide to buy it, it is still worth it.", "num_friends": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 12, "num_groups": 1, "steam_id_number": "76561198024473245", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 10, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 1, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.003484320557491289, "num_achievements_possible": 287}, "date_posted": "Jan 8, 2015, 9:51AM", "username": "weeman64789"}

Its not outstanding like the earlier versions but it is always going to be difficult to develop it so far forward without ruining the gaming or changing it beyond recognition. So far I haven't had any major issues with injuries and the match engine is fine with no silly mistakes and goals from all over the pitch.

And, aside from that, this years' version (though weirdly under publicised for some reason) is a comparatively huge leap forward for the franchise and I would reccommend it to anyone - even if you have ZERO interest in football. Hell I'm not even a fan of football myself - it's just that the tactical depth of this game is unsurpassed by ANYTHING else out there. Most importantly for fans of the series the overhaul on the match engine this time has really made games a joy to watch, touchline instructions following advice from your assistant are vastly more intuitive, the tactics editor is finally streamlined AND comprehensive, and the old tool-tips system has been replaced by a novel and extremely usefull \"?\" help system. It isn't without small faults. The random training injuries this year can seem extreme. Your best player can be out for a season for being injured whilst picking his nose. I know footballers are pansies but come on! Experienced players will find that it takes some adjusting to familiarise yourself with where everything is despite all the help and information now made available. Some of the player interactions, whilst they certainly make things more interesting, just arent that likely - getting totally raged on by one of your players simply because he does not play in every single game can snowball into him deliberately infecting the rest of the team and the board sacking you and, again, I find this a little extreme. Also, the new ability to use social media doesn't work quite the way it should and is heavilly biased toward Google. Despite its many tiny flaws this years version IS far better than any that have gone before. The negative reviews from long term fans are, in my opinion, written by people who do not like change.

I've played FM since the 2005 edition and FM15 is my favourite iteration yet. The game makes you feel, now more than ever, like you're in charge of a football team that is composed of individuals, not spreadsheets. Here are the pros and cons I've found so far: =======PROS=========== -Player management has been revamped this year and players behave more realistically than ever. You cannot sign a player on a key player wage, not play him and expect him to be satisfied if you drop him for no reason. Additionally, other players in the squad may side with him and make your position untenable (resulting in you getting sacked for \"losing the dressing room\"), or on the contrary, complain about you treating him too kindly if you give in to his demands. Players going to the press will also get picked up a lot more and you will be facing insistent and often annoying questions on how you're handling the player in question. This leads me to the next pro: -Improvements to media handling. Anyone who complains about the increase in media occasions from FM14 must not know that you can give over control of media handling to your assistant. Handling the media is a key part of any managerial job and I appreciate the fact that SI have tried to make it feel as real as ever. Having a pesky journo run after me in the tunnel after a  performance, I found myself snapping at him, which shows how effective adding these (rather small) features has been at enhancing the experience of managing a football club. -The match engine is a lot prettier than earlier versions. -The interface, while it takes some getting used to, is great and feels a lot crispier than earlier versions. Small decisions like splitting staff and player searches into the \"staff\" and \"scouting\" categories make the game easier to navigate. -Scouting has been vastly improved and it is now easier than ever to make the scouts suit your needs rather than them giving you reports you don't want to see. The option to have them scout leagues for specific player types, such as a replacement for an ageing first team player or a promising youngster, also add to the organic feel of the game. ============CONS=============== -Although the match engine has been tweaked since the release, it still needs a bit of work. Crossing and long shots by players who, given their attributes, really have no business hitting 30 yard screamers 5 times a season still exist although they're being worked on. -Injuries seem to happen in waves, where you'll spend 6 months injury free and then have 5 players get long term injuries in the same week. It's frustrating, but again, the last patch did introduce changes to injury probabilities... It just needs to be tweaked a bit. -Although I enjoy the new interface, the tactics screen absolutely sucks and needs to be changed in future patches. The \"star for the players' comfort in that position and circle around it to indicate suitability compared to the rest of the squad\" in particular is hideous. if it's that difficult to describe in writing, then it shouldn't be a feature. Those are the major gripes I have on the game. The \"losing against promoted teams when you're on a 5 game win streak\" may be frustrating, but if you look at real life football that's often what happens, teams who perform well against strong opposition may get complacent and slip up against minnows. The fact of the matter is that if you love football, no game out there will allow you to experience the beautiful game quite like FM15 does. The changes aren't perfect but they're there, and SI has patched issues that the playerbase found with the game, and say what you will about them, they're passionate about football and really care about their game. Which game dew do you know who would go and get written permission from a 15 year old wonderkid's parents just so they could put him in the game and let players see how he turns out? The game is far from perfect but I've put dozens of hours into it so far and have enjoyed every second of it. I can't review FM Classic as I don't touch it, but the fully simulated experience is as close to managing a football club as you'll ever get without going into the profession yourself. 9/10.", "num_friends": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 9, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561197992923403", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 5, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 13, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.21666666666666667, "num_achievements_possible": 60}, "date_posted": "Dec 22, 2014, 8:16AM", "username": "Stein"}

And finally, that tear-strewn, crack-of-dawn moment when you realise you just can't take it anymore, your finger trembling over the mouse as you finally click \"delete\". Football Manager is nothing more than page upon page of statistical data, offset with the occasional virtual match that you can't actually control, but to the many fans of the sport, it inspires an infatuation unrivalled in the world of video games. A feeling of power and control not unlike that of the Civilization series, but on a more realistic and micromanaged scale. You take charge as head manager of your favourite football team, and through player and staff purchases, regular training, plenty of tactical planning and the occasional bit of luck, you can guide them to fulfilling victory - or frustrating loss. Unlike its playable football counterpart in the FIFA series, developer Sports Interactive has year after year ensured that its latest iteration is always a significant overhaul of the previous edition, bringing back compulsive fans not just with updated rosters, but through key feature changes and additions. This year's FM2015 release has a host of updated features. Aside from the updated 3D match engine graphics on \"game day\", the true highlight is the option to choose between being a \"tracksuit manager\" and a \"tactical manager\", the two often overlapping in previous editions. Here, the choice between getting deeply involved in either the training or strategies is an important factor not just in the gameplay, but in how players and staff react to you as a leader. The only real problem with this true-to-life recreation is that accuracy is occasionally taken too far, such as in the unfocused but essential meetings. Regular chats with your staff and press are required to place your team at the forefront of this money-controlled world, but it often comes at the expense of entertainment. It's true that realism should be the goal, but a balance is necessary, especially when repetition starts to set in. FM15 doesn't break new ground but it does build on a decades-old formula to ensure your life will soon be dominated by a delusion-filled virtual world of fictional players, fake matches and simulated football management.", "num_friends": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 12, "num_groups": 2, "steam_id_number": "76561198162123802", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 8, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.25, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 38, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.4318181818181818, "num_achievements_possible": 88}, "date_posted": "Nov 24, 2014, 10:38AM", "username": "Mert"}

After reading all the negative reviews from users I was a bit hesitant but from what I've read SI patches the games well. I decided to purchase and jumped into classic mode with Chelsea right way. This is the first FM I have purchased. I was expecting all these injury bugs and high scores and after my first game I thought here we go as I won 5-0. I played 5 games, and tried to sign 2 players in my brief time. scores for the 5 games are as follows. 5-0 W 3-0 W 0-3 L 3-1 W 0-1 L as far as I can tell the scores don't look out of whack. 1 player rejected me, the other player failed his medical, kinda cool. As for injuries, yes there were some injuries but a lot of them were knocks and nothing really major. I had a couple of major injuries but by major I mean they missed 11days to 2weeks time and were back in my first squad. That's the point of building a solid squad and having backups that can step in, same as real football. I'd say it's on par with fifa 2015 in terms of injuries and score lines. I set my tactics and I quick picked my squad each game so that i could just get through. I will play a new season upcoming, just wanted to get the feeling for the game. Anyway. Since I'm not a veteran to FM I can't say if this is an upgrade or downgrade to previous iterations but I can say that I've stopped playing certain games (Madden, COD) because of their repetition and 'non improving' of game play. (awful sentence, I know), so I can see both sides of the coin. For now I enjoy this game, and hope to continue to enjoy it. The real names / face packs / logo packs / kit packs that other users have created definitely help. Also having any league and any team available unlike fifa is a joy. Hope to put in plenty of more hours.", "num_friends": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 1, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198146039771", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 1, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.25, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 32, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.3047619047619048, "num_achievements_possible": 105}, "date_posted": "Nov 12, 2014, 8:14AM", "username": "siraks55"}

The gameplay is great, I love how the game is set out, like i said it's the first football manager i've played and it was so easily to learn where everything was and how to use it. I uise an Apple Mac to play this addicting game, and I must say it is extremely quick, i've had no major problems at all, downloaded super fast, i believe it only took a few minutes to actually instal which is awesome as i could'nt wait to get stuck in. However i only have one incy wincy problem which annoys me a little, i don't know if it's just me but it seems after the first season it gets rather difficult to achieve expectations and not get sacked, like i said i don't know if that is just me, i mught just be bad at this game but i'm not too sure. I started my first season with Portsmouth and got promoted to league 1, but the next season they expected me to be promted again to the championship and gave me around 1.4M to spend, realistically i thought this was impossible. I was right. So the next season after that they only gave me 250K so that really wasn't near enough the budget i had in mind, i ended up resigning and joined middlesbrough for a season, i completely flopped and only got a mid table finish (predicted promotion) i got the sack unsuprisingly and then joined Cardiff. They also expected promotion (which i failed) so now i'm on my second season with Cardiff and i've tried so many different tactics and none of them seem to work, im obnly around 10games in but i'm doing so bad. My team is by far the best in the championship yet it doesnt seem to perform. But still like i said i dont know if it's just me or not... Finally, this is probably the best game i've ever invested in (as well as FIFA) even through it gets frustrating at times, you still come back ever day and play a few more games. Very sorry for rambling on but i hope you all find this helpful. If you are lucky enough to have the opportunity to buy this game just like me then GET IT!

There are maybe 2 or 3 new speches in team talk, some more advanced conversations with players which are actualy harder to talk to and overal the personal chat has been developed. Yes theres also a 3d game play shown rather than 2d which actualy does not add anything to a manager expirience and in my opinion is nice but unnecesary. There are few minor bugs with the game, theres also a \"fair play\" requirements to get into european competitons but other than that theres not a lot of new suprises. This is still my favourite football manager game but other than few little changes, updated squads and competition rules this game is preety much the old 2013 manager to me. Its still a good game worth a buy if your upgrading your football manager 6/10.

I have played the franchise for years also and i am loving this edition. May be it is because i have just brought it and it has been updated but everything including the match engine have been drastically improved. The injurys are nothing out of the ordanary and i am playing with Arsenal. Goals per game are very realistic, and i have had only 2 big wins out of 10 games yet i have lost only 1 friendly and the charity sheild against city which ended 2-0. What ever the other reviews said negitivly about this game i have seen none of so far, and to think i almost took note of what people where saying and almost never brought it and i am so glad i did. cdkeys sold it for 20.91 and it was well worth it already. Didnt think i liked the dark skin and i was disappointed that it was the only one but after trying a few of the custom light skins i soon went back and love the original dark skin now.

I'm not experiencing these \"random\" results at all, and the goals that are scored are can almost everytime be traced to a tactical flaw or strength, as opposed to FM14 where that percentage would've been about 50. I'm not experiencing this whole thing with vast amounts of goals being scored/conceded either, nor the comeback issue people have been reporting. I feel like these issues sound like typical beta issues (remember, it is a beta you've been playing) that will be resolved quickly, but will see. Either way, I'm good. Corners have been improved, where tactics and player attributes actually make a difference for once, and it is now finally possible to score on free kicks and longshots again (it was of course possible before - but not even the best players in the world would even be close to a realistically decent conversion rate).", "num_friends": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 1, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198134811788", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 2, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.2727272727272727, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 77, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.46107784431137727, "num_achievements_possible": 167}, "date_posted": "Nov 7, 2014, 2:38AM", "username": "Cat of Honor"}

UI: The new UI is great, even though it comes down to personal preference. Many people don't like the new sidebar, but I persoanlly think it's pretty good. The whole UI is also a lot cleaner. AI: The AI is pretty realistic, even though clubs sometimes make unrealistic demands of players, while they could just say that they aren't interested in selling the player. Other then that, I don't really have any problems with this. Also, some people don't like the scouting of players, but this is just meant to be realistic. You are always free to play Football Manager classic, which doesn't include a lot of the time consuming features, such as team talks and continuous scouting. Match Engine: When people say the match engine is horrible, they do have a point. Horrible, horrible goalkeepers, defenders not knowing how to defend, strikers dribbling right through defenders, and these are only a few of the bad stuff. This normally wouldn't be a problem, but the match result is determined by the match engine as the game continues, so goalkeepers make stupid mistakes like not responding quick enough, and so you lose because of that. This, for me, is pretty much the only bad thing about FM15, even though this is like one of the most important parts. Multiplayer: Now, I don't think anyone else thinks this, but I think FM's multiplayer is horrible. The season goes on without you when some people are on, and it's just messed up and complicated. I haven't played multiplayer much, but this is just my experience from multiplayer. Conclusion: This is a great game, i don't know if people who are already fans of the series need to buy this one, but people just starting with the series should definitely get this.

Although I am new to the game itself, I am an avid football fan. So here a quick whats good and whats bad in my opinion. Please remember I'm new to FM and will say what I like from my point of view, regardless of whether it has been in the FM franchise in the past or if It was better on old versions. What's good; -Modern menu system which is easy to navigate -Lot of reposibilites which make gameplay feel realistic. -Ability to assign assistant manager to roles like dealing with training etc. -In Game graphics are exceptable (However dont accept Fifa or PES standard) -Games have felt realistic and in game tactics make a massive difference What's Bad; - I really could not get to grips with the scouting system. On both of my two careers so far I have created a scouting assignment in which no players have been scouted or suggested to me. Nothing at ALL! Maybe I'm the one at fault but that is not my fault as the game didnt explain it properly to me. I have yet to make a single signing yet due to not being able to find an adequate player who meets my scout report. - I have started 2 careers and in both the same transfers were happening. Southampton Bought Jo from CAM and Naughton from Tottenham, and also sold Clyne to Spurs in both careers. As well as Man U buying Vertonghen and Khedira going to Chelsea. I found it annoying because I wanted to see a variation and to be interested in the other signings rather than seeing the same deals happen. -(This maybe like something I havent downloaded or something not sure tbh) I expected players to have faces and also the top division clubs from the BPL to have the official badges but they don't. Overall I would recommend this game because of the potential of reach 3 digits of game time.

I've not once had anywhere near a full strength team and Falcao even got injured for 6 months. It seems I'm picking up two injuries a game. Other than that the game is very good. The scouting in particular has been greatly improved. On previous versions of FM it almost seemed too easy to find amazing players and judge who was going to be the next big thing. Now a lot less players appear when searching for transfers, meaning you'll have to send your scouts out to other leagues and teams to gather information. They've also added the option to scout an individual player for serveral months with more indepth scouting reports. If you're already big into FM and have played previous versions I think it's a big enough update from 14 to be worth purchasing and for those who've never played it, the way that SI have arranged their tabs and generally neatened up and simplified the layout of the game makes FM 15 the most accesible for a while.", "num_friends": null, "num_reviews": 1, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 1, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "lukestieson", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 2, "found_helpful_percentage": 0.375, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 56, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.5333333333333333, "num_achievements_possible": 105}, "date_posted": "Nov 5, 2014, 8:14PM", "username": "lukestieson"}

With all that i can assure you this version of FM is another milestone ( somehow like fm 2008 was ). At the start of Beta/early access the game was a bit buggy and match engine needed a lot of tweeks but yet another time SI and their team step up to the challenge and ACTUALY LISTEN to the community. In last 14 days they hotfixed most of the issues and game is very enjoyable. Surely the most realistc one to date. Cant wait for todays release to play with my friend on multiplayer. If you are series fan you cant miss it.

Many issues which were solved years ago have come back: - Too many goals from corners - Too many goals from crosses - WAY too many injuries. My last game: 1yellow/red card and 3 serious injuries. ONE ing game. - stupid mistakes from goalkeepers (yes, the passing issue is still there). - very bad user interface in the tactic area. It was much better in FM 2014 - Same tranfer AI issues we saw within FM 2006 or 2007. AI is buying players for too much money. AI teams demand too much money for young talents: 30-40 mio+ - Instant goals from the oppostions: dominate the game, score a goal and watch how yout opponent scores 20 seconds later. - Leading 2 : 0 often leads to a sudden rush of the opponent which results in a 2 : 3 Good things: New scouting area is an improvement. I like the bar on the left, but this has already been in the game years ago. It was removed, now it is back. I made this experiences with a team playing against relegation in the first geman league. Maybe the FM feels better if you play with a team like Barcelona. In total not worth the money for me. It feels like they published a reskinnend version of FM2006. Better wait for some patches and watch the community. ******************************************************************************************************************** UPDATE: 02.12.2014: SI has released 2 Updates. From what I experience now the game has improved and Im currently enjoying it. Big improvement: - stupid mistakes from goalkeepers (yes, the passing issue is still there). Have not seen this any more. Big improvement - Leading 2 : 0 often leads to a sudden rush of the opponent which results in a 2 : 3 The \"rush\" is still present but normally the AI will score ones and then youll be able to make it 3-1. Or maybe 3-2. Big improvement: - Too many goals from crosses In my opinion the amount of goals after crosses has come to a normal level. But I have also worked on my tactic. Improved: - Too many goals from corners Its has been improved, but I still seem to concede many goals after corners. This could also be an issue of my tactic. Slightly improved: - very bad user interface in the tactic area. It was much better in FM 2014 Player roles are back on the tactic screen, but still a bit complicated. No change: - WAY too many injuries. I still got many injuries. Sometimes it is very annoying BUT the good thing is, that most of the injuries are not serious. It seems like there is a higher chance to get serious injuries during the season breaks. Within the season, I am often faced with injuries during matches but so are normally only minor things. Max 3-4 Weeks. Could be balanced a bit. No Change: - Same tranfer AI issues we saw within FM 2006 or 2007. AI is buying players for too much money. AI teams demand too much money for young talents: 30-40 mio+. AI is releasing too many players for free. This is my biggest complain with the game. The Transfer-AI is still stupid. Apart from the huge amount of money the top AI-Teams are spending, you will also be able to find very good player for free. For example: Bayern is releasing Xherdan Shaqiri for free. In real life they are demanding 25 Million Euro. This means that you will be able to upgrade your team from a mid class club to a european top-team wihtin a couple of seasons. WAY too easy! This was already an issue of previous FM Games. Conclusion: I have improved my tactic to handle the match engine issues. After the updates I was able to set my wing backs from defend to support duties, without getting rushed by the AI. Good thing because you dont feel so helpless anymore and this gives you the opportunity to try more things. Thank god that the issue with leads of 2 - 0 is gone. That was very annoying. Overall I have started enjoying the FM. Scouting is really fun now and makes more sence. The transfer AI should be improved with the next updates, same procedure as every year.....but Im sure the issue with too many good free player will not be solved... also likey every other year in FM history. So I can now recommend the game.....but never preorder it ;-)", "num_friends": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 15, "num_groups": 2, "steam_id_number": "John_Snow198", "date_updated": "Dec 2, 2014, 3:07AM", "num_badges": 14, "found_helpful_percentage": null, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 48, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.45714285714285713, "num_achievements_possible": 105}, "date_posted": "Nov 24, 2014, 7:01AM", "username": "John_Snow198"}

I regret buying it and have gone back to FM14.--- This game is definitely not as bad as some of the reviews say, though it does have it's problems. I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the series. Let's go through the pros and cons: Pros: - I like the new UI, I think it's improved on previous titles, with things like scouting/transfers in more logical places - It runs smoother: you no longer have that weird 10 second pause when changing tactics in a match; instead it takes less than 2 seconds. This means you can make lots more changes in the match withou being annoyed by the pause every single time. - I haven't seen the oft mentioned issues with getting lots of injuries; its stayed around the same as previous titles on that front for me. -Player interaction and media interaction are considerably improved Cons: - Weirdly takes longer to save than FM14. Over a minute and a half for me. - The games ARE too high scoring, and this needs to be patched for realism purposes. I just had 5 games that were 6-3, 6-3, 5-3, 0-0 (lol) and 6-3 again... a bit silly... - Goalkeepers are pretty bad, hence the high scores. - It feels like it's harder to play a possession game, but that might be just because I'm Leicester. It's a fun game; I'm definitely glad I bought it. Good for fans of the series; if patched it could be brilliant.

Original review, my first and only game review (I was that  off) is below. I was negative. I'll hold my hands up now though and admit that -while still not perfect- the game is playable, seems to be fair, better balanced and without most of the big game breaking faults. I've done about 8 seasons now, mostly offline so forgive the lack of played hours, it's a decent game. It's not the best, I still prefer fm12 and cm01/02 in terms of hours played, but it's matured to be a decent entry. Cheers devs, cheers tactical genius people for the mutley tweak formation, cheers to you for reading. I recommend the game. Original review. I'm a big fan of fm games, been playing since 01/02 and have enjoyed many hundreds of hours of game time. I've been playing fm2015 since release, mostly offline (I have a lot more hours than probably shown and I have more than one account). This is the first time I've ever reviewed a game, I'm doing so because it's just so broken I feel I have to. For every person saying the game is broken, there's another saying it's because of bad tactics etc. Well, for me it's just a rage inducing festival of disappointment. Yes there's going to be bugs, yes there's going to be the odd quirk, but when you reload a save and replay the same fixture a dozen times, using different squads and tactics and still concede an own goal in the 90th minute after conceding an 85th minute wonder strike, something is up. Nothing I do seems to make a difference to the evidently pre-planned scoreline. You could edit in the best players in the world and they'd still lose 2-1 to Sheffield flippin' Wednesday everytime on my save. I can live with the slightly mad bits of the game, players demanding to leave then moaning when they're transfer listed or your only expensive purchase always getting a long term injury in first half of his second match for example, but when you get the impression that you're merely following a pre-ordained set of results, there's kind of no point. It's a terrible shame and although I expect it'll all be fixed eventually, it's the one game I feel absolutely cheated by. 30 can get you a fair bit in the Steam store, do think very carefully before spending it on a game that actually makes you (for the first time ever) angry at playing. If you find otherwise, if you find it to be brilliant, good on you. I know the developers are active in the forums, trying to sort stuff out which deserves some credit, but they've got their work cut out.

What is not just an opinion, is the horrible match engine. There is basically two options which each have their different negatives. 2D engine: your team will score and conceed like , it's totally normal that a game between BVB and Bayern Munich would end up 4:7 or something crazy like that. 3D engine: players are just stupid as f**. Almost every tackle is a sliding tackle, people will just consider 'hey let's not pick up that ball that is only 5 metres away from me because my mate that is 30 metres away is already going for it'. Overall the AI in 3D mode is just rubbish. Goalkeepers do not know how to get out of the box, even when they are set to Sweeper Keeper attack. If they somehow get out on occasion tho, they will just do stupid runs for the ball near the corner flag which result in very easy long shot goals for the opposition. Sorry S.I, but you failed.

I had my doubts about buying FM15 after that but when I seen it on sale I though I would give it ago and I found it much better, alot has improved. There is still some work to do on the match engine, it is now more realistic I guess but still stumble around abit but it's better than i've seen it before. The defence seems much better, it's hard to get around depending on the strengh on your defence so I was happy with that. As for the interface in game I was happy with that also, it's now much easier to get around and you have all information on your homescreen.

I went to buy a player at Man United and asked the board, they said that they agree however cant afford LOL (really) Also some teams are way overated like Liverpool and others .Programmer must have a liverpool shirt on Steven im dead gerrard beat walcott in a race for the ball WTF", "num_friends": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Not Recommended", "friend_player_level": 1, "num_groups": null, "steam_id_number": "76561198205794575", "date_updated": null, "num_badges": 1, "found_helpful_percentage": null, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 2, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.2, "num_achievements_possible": 10}, "date_posted": "Jul 15, 2015, 12:55PM", "username": "Silver 1 Smerf"}

When the pre-order became available I brought it. Since the Beta I have had many saves. For many people Football Manager isn't just a game but a way of life. I started in the Beta as Watford Manager (My favourite club), I played this save through the beta and in this time won the triple, the Prem, FA cup and capital one. Then I moved on to a journey man save, my manager had Sunday league experience with no coaching badges and over the 15 year period I managed 7 clubs in 6 different leagues winning 7 pieces of silver ware. Then I am currently playing as Stevenage manager with the aim to make the club self-sufficient, with currently being in 2026 and one every competition I have been in in the last 4 years (Would be 5 but thanks to arsenal I lost the fa cup). Moving onto the game. Going from fm14 where I have over 760 hours the UI was very different seeing the task bar moving from the top to the side was very weird, but unlike first thought takes up less room as well as makes tasks easier. Personally I dont use skins but with the community out there finding a perfect skin is easy. With badges and kits I always mod the game in this particular side although when I first loaded the game I was happy to see nearly every league had the kits and badges except for Germany and the English Premier League due to licenses. The Match engine is extremely better than the previous years and this makes the game so much better. With the FM community the badges, kits and more is available to combat the license issues. With finding regens and making them world class you can easily create bonds with the players. Overall I have over 1150 hours playing this beautiful game and I have extremely enjoyed the game and will continue to enjoy FM15. For many of the players they will agree Football Manager is a way of life. This game is completely worth its price. From Regen hunting (where you look for good young players to develop) to just straight up winning games, if you love football this game is for you.", "num_friends": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "num_guides": 0, "rating": "Recommended", "friend_player_level": 5, "num_groups": 2, "steam_id_number": "76561198035973973", "date_updated": "Jul 16, 2015, 11:21AM", "num_badges": 3, "found_helpful_percentage": null, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_attained": 68, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.6476190476190476, "num_achievements_possible": 105}, "date_posted": "Jul 16, 2015, 11:18AM", "username": "TheJamesG"}
